# Steldan isola
The Steldan isola lies at the north-western end of the [Steldan Mountains](TODO), above the [Wall of Ice and Stone](TODO).
The isola is home to **TODO** people, of which most are [irds](TODO).
After the [Penance](TODO), the lower plains of the region were flooded with nix over the course of the years.
The population fled up the mountains, establishing many of the towns that are populated today.
This isolated them from the rest of [Yuadrem](TODO), thus establishing the isola.
The inhabitants of the isola have not had any contact with the outside world for almost two centuries.

There are three major currents of thought as of 802 A.S: [Statism](politics/statism), [Liberalism](politics/liberalism), and [Recuperationism](politics/recuperationism).

## Politics
The central government of the isola resides in [Ironfox](TODO).
Its head is the [ead](../../../cultures/krudzal/political_hierarchy), who is elected by the council of five every ten years.
The territory is separated into six eadsbeers, each of which is ruled by a democratically elected udtere.
Any citizen can vote in the election.
A citizen is any person over 30 years with an active job recognized by the state.

The current ead is [Jaser](TODO), elected in 802 A.S.
His government is young, and he hasn't gained the trust of the people yet.
While he is a statist, he is very young and seen as volatile by the older statists.
He is the son of the previous ead, [Nernet](TODO), and is sympathetic towards recuperationists.

# Recuperationism
Somewhat simpler than [statism](../statism) and [liberalism](../liberalism), recuperationists aim to re-establish communication with the rest of Krudzal.
The common belief in the steldan isola is that all of the country was lost to nix in [The Penance](TODO), including its people.
Recuperationists challenge this belief: They think that other bastions of civilization exist.
Their plan is to start by contacting [Krugghom](TODO).
From there, they seek to expand outward and check on the rest of the krudzalian settlements, creating a network of communication and travel between isolas.

Followers of recuperationism aren't in favor or in opposition of either of the dominant doctrines.
They agree with liberalists on the fact that more focus should be put into piercing [nix](TODO), but disagree on overtaking statism for this.
They do concur on a democratization of violence however.
How is any exploration to take place without proper protection?

Most sympathizers with the doctrine belong to or openly support the [Steldan Debridement Front](../../groups/sdf).
They channel whatever resources on backing up the group, together with their hope for the restoration of [Krudzal](TODO).

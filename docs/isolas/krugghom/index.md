# Krugghom
As its name suggests, this isola lies in the capital of the old nation of Krudzal, Krugghom.
The isola is home to **TODO** people, most of which are humes<!-- TODO. Link. --> of ird descent.
The city's position high above the Kure protected it from nix<!-- [nix](TODO) -->.
The isola has not been in communication with the rest of Yuadrem ever since the Penance.

The current government follows the recuperationist philosophy.
It teaches the belief that other bastions of civilization exist, and it makes an active effort to regain contact with them.

## Politics
The nation is comprised by only one city, Krugghom.
The city is ruled by a supplementary state<!-- [supplementary state](TODO) --> built from the ranks of the debridement army<!-- [debridement army](TODO) -->.
This government took power after the Coup of 779<!-- [Coup of 779](TODO) --> that sparked from the assassination of [traad](../../nations/krudzal/political_hierarchy) Nuri<!-- [Nuri](TODO) -->.
This government has held power up until 802 A.S, and remains unchallenged insofar.

<!-- In the year 779 AS, the last [traad](../../../nations/krudzal/hierarchy), [Nuri](TODO), was assassinated by a lieutenant of the [militia](TODO), [Sulrech Witherslayer](TODO).
This led to a short-lived civil war, out of which a [supplementary state](TODO) rose from the [debridement army](TODO).
Due to a lack of political stability, this government has held power for about 2 decades. -->

## Religion
The main religion in Krudzal is [Tanethism](../../religions/tanethism).
The practice quickly gained popularity by the late Nations Era<!-- [Nations Era](TODO) --> from the evangelization efforts of Olag<!-- [Olag](TODO) --> and the Seven Principates of the Sea<!-- [Seven Principates of the Sea](TODO) -->.
Despite this, there are still a few followers of the old religion of the region, Tsalemism<!-- [Tsalemism](TODO) -->.

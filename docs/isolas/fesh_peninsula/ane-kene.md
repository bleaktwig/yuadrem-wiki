# Ane-Kene
Ane-kene is the sociological agreement proposed by the [Febrid](../../religion/mevic_gods/febrid.md) temple in Ferames<!-- TODO. Link. -->. The system has seen wide adoption in the Sumi of Ushpavam<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and is spreading thorough the [Fesh Peninsula](index.md).
<!-- TODO. Mention the relation between ane-kene and Tanethism. Concepts in the domain of a god are especially crucial -- failing to fulfill them is an insult to the related god. -->
<!-- TODO. Mention that this system is born out of a need to cooperate in the face of nix, and there's a goal to extend it to the whole peninsula. -->
<!-- TODO. UPDATE LINKS TO RELIGION. -->

The system starts with the individual, or the Ivu, and builds structures from them. These structures start from the Ivu, and are sustained by them—power is built from the bottom-up, not top-down as in the kingdoms of old.

## Ivu
The ivu is the individual person, their body and soul. Every ivu has common needs, capacities, and most importantly, time. In ane-kene, the ivu dedicates part of their time to their community, which in turn provides for the ivu's needs. The ivu has four fundamental needs, which should be provided by the community to allow for the stability of the ane-kene.

* **Yalu**, or the daily food required for the subsistence of the ivu.
* **Wese**, which is the clean drink needed for the survival of the ivu. Both yalu and wese are part of the domain of [Matevos](../../religion/mevic_gods/matevos.md).
* **Taka**, the private property of the ivu. An ivu's posessions should fit inside an itus, a large vase which is provided by the bulu. For a traveling ivu, their backpack acts as an extension of their itus.
* **Nuga**, or the right to die. Every ivu has the right to forfeit their own life, should they choose to do so. Both the taka and the nuga are part of the domain of [Fagal](../../religion/damic_gods/fagal.md).

**Buni.** With the lack of a central state, a thing that is absent is a central money system. While some bulus and tegas have established a local currency, nearby it is most common for bulus to regulate exchange through a gift economy. In this context, the act of an ivu giving a thing to another ivu, a bulu, or even a whole tega, is the buni. The buni is part of the domain of [Zash](../../religion/damic_gods/zash.md).

**Kana.** Finally, a group of ivus who share a household are a kana. Usually, a number between 15 and 30 ivus pertain in a kana. While the specifics depend on the particular bulu, it is common for ivus in a kana to share childbearing duties. When a group of kanas living in close proximity collaborate with each other, they can form a bulu.

## Bulu
A bulu is a self-sufficient community of ivus. Its size usually ranges between 100 and 500 ivus, but smaller bulus do exist, such as nomadic bulus. Bulus are often characterized by the nima, the pili, and the pali.

* **Nima** is the cultural identity of a bulu, defining the everyday life of the ivu. The nima is conformed by a group of like-minded ivus.
* **Pili** is the form of communication and exchange defined on a bulu. While most bulus work only on the basis of buni, some may establish different systems, currency-based or otherwise.
* **Pali** is the degree of self-sufficiency of a bulu. Most bulus have a strong pali, but it is common for some to be weaker in this regard, with the obvious example of nomadic bulus. The pali is part of the domain of [Vahan](../../religion/mevic_gods/vahan.md).

**Sila.** The agreement between an ivu and the bulu in which they live is the sila. The sila is a spoken agreement where the ivu promises their time to the bulu, while the bulu promises to fulfill the needs of the ivu.

* **Kudu** is the agricultural and hunting basis of a bulu, with the goal to provide the yalu and wese of the ivu.
* **Bete** is the responsibility of the bulu to provide healthcare for the ivus. Both kudu and bete are the domain of [Bagrat](../../religion/mevic_gods/bagrat.md).
* **Ganu** is the physical space used by the bulu. The ganu should have enough size to house all ivus pertaining the bulu, in a way corresponding to the nima of the bulu.
* **Sibi** stands for all things that concern the production, use, and distribution of things in the bulu. It should provide for the needs of the ivu, including the taka. Both the ganu and sibi are the domain of [Febrid](../../religion/mevic_gods/febrid.md).

**Fasi**. The kudu, ganu, sibi, and bete of a bulu should be able to provide for all ivus that live in it. In addition, they should maintain a surplus of around a sixth of their consumption. This surplus is known as fasi, and is offered to travelers and visiting nomadic bulus. Fasi is part of the domain of [Zash](../../religion/damic_gods/zash.md).

**Kene.** Due to the variety of bulus, it is common for them to establish agreements and common enterprises. This is the kene. If enough bulus in close proximity establish kenes with each other, they might decide to form a tega.

**Fenu.** To barter, two bulus may build a fenu with each other. The fenu is written agreement where one bulu promises to deliver an amount of something in exchange of an amount of something else from the other bulu. For one-time barter a kene is enough for this purpose -- a fenu is usually reserved for regular trade between two bulus. A bulu should have all its fenus recorded on a stone tablet, the **Sadi**.

## Tega
A tega is a community of bulus tethered together via kenes. Usually composed of 10-30 bulus, a tega can have a population of anything between 1.000 and 10.000 ivus. Tegas with larger populations are very uncommon, and are named **ane-tegas**. The establishment of a tega requires a special ritual in celebration of [Pagram](../../religion/mevic_gods/pagram.md).

Since organization under ane-kene is done at the bulu level, the tega do not hold any specific responsibilities. Yet, for tega-wide decisions, an assembly is formed.

* **Dala.** The dala is an assembly made to take decisions that matter for the entire tega. To ensure representation, each bulu must choose two delegates, a woman and a man, to attend this assembly. Depending on the needs of the tega, a dala can be either a one-time thing, or a regular event.
* **Dudi.** In the rare event that a sumi-wide decision must be taken, a dala is held in every tega. Bulus outside of tegas are encouraged to send representatives to these dalas as well. In this dala, the concerning events are discussed, and a woman and a man are chosen. These two are sent to a sumi-wide dala, held at a temple to Pagram chosen beforehand, where the plan about the concerning issue must be taken. It's worth noting that this kind of event has never ocurred since the establishment of the ane-kene.

## Buda and Sumi
**Buda.** It is expected for bulus to have farms or other resources beyond their ganu. Due to this, some degree of organization is necessary outside of the bulu, especially if they have neighbors nearby. The buda is the geographic region designed for this purpose. A buda does not have a specific size, but relates to the distribution of bulus and natural resources.

**Mafa.** While bulus should be self-sufficient, this doesn't mean that they're to be resilient to the worst emergencies -- no one is. In the case of a natural disaster, a threat from outsiders, or a nix tide, at least one emergency cache should be available to each buda. This is the mafa, and is part of the domain of [Vahan](../../religion/mevic_gods/vahan.md).

**Sumi.** The sumi is the ideal of ane-kene. It is the collective of all mafas formed, allowing the collective to make choices that concern their whole world. While ideally there should be one sumi, currently there are two, mainly due to geographical distance: the Sumi of Ushpavam and the Sumi of Fremit.

## Yaka
While most problems are expected to be solved peacefully, ane-kene doesn't refuse the need for violence in specially difficult problems. This is enabled through the yaka. The yaka is a duel between at least two ivus, and must be regulated by their respective bulus. If it is impossible to solve the dispute without violence, the yaka will be carried out. It is the duty of the bulus to ensure that the yaka is regulated with the following rules:

* The formal challenge must take place in the presence of at least two witnesses.
* The challenged can always be refused.
* The respective bulus must be invited to try for reconciliation.
* The choice of weapons and armor and of time for the duel are made by the bulus, and should be fair to all participants.
* The duel must take place in the presence of delegates from the bulu.
* The duel ends whenever one of the parties cannot continue fighting, or the challenged declares defeat.

The yaka is expected to be rare, but is a necessary tradition to avoid unorganized violence. In the case of violent disagreements between bulus, each bulu should respect the ane-kene and resolve the conflict using willing delegates.

The godess [Fusine](../../religion/mevic_gods/fusine.md) is associated to the resolution of all conflicts, but is particularly venerated in the yaka.

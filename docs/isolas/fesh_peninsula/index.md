The large influx of people during the Age of Fog<!-- TODO. Link. --> caused the collapse of the nations that originally occupied the peninsula. While some groups of people have declared new nations over time, most of the peninsula is currently in a state of anarchy. To aid the organization of communities, the [ane-kene](ane-kene.md) system was proposed by the monks of the [Febrid](../../religions/tanethism_pantheon.md#febrid) temple in Ferames<!-- TODO. Link. -->. The system was widely adopted by the nearby territories, and is gradually spreading through the peninsula.

**TODO.**

<!-- TODO.
    * Talk more about the adoption of the system, and the nations that are against it (like the Holy Nation of Ushpavam!).

# Pheter
Pheter is the god of Disparity, Creation, War, and Spring.

They were born from [Nix](nix.md) in the [_Nascency of Disparity_](../../history.md#prehistory), and their arrival led to the creation of everything. Pheter is the progenitor of the [damic](../index.md#damic-gods) and [mevic](../index.md#mevic-gods) gods, and all creation leads back to the divinity. They've revealed themself to mortals in many occasions, most commonly in the form of a pair of maguari storks, an equal balance of the six colors dancing through their bodies.

In Darhoc<!-- TODO. Link. -->, they manifest as a transparent, inodorous matter that permeates the entirety of the planet, simply named pheter. Every time disparity is created, it is conducted through this substance, consuming some of it. This wanton consumption is what led to the [Age of Sap](../../history.md#age-of-sap), and what will end up allowing nix to consume all of life.

Unlike the other gods, no glyph is associated to Pheter, as they are the one that gives meaning to symbols in the first place.

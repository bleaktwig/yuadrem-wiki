# Pheter
Pheter is the god of Disparity and Creation. They were born in the _Nascency of Disparity_<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and their arrival meant the creation of everything. Pheter is the progenitor of the Damic gods, and all creation can be attributed to them. Their representation is a pair of maguari storks, with an equal balance of the six colors moving across their bodies.

Pheter is the source of magic that allows apomantics<!-- TODO. Link. --> to work. For this, their body manifests as a transparent, inodorous matter that permeates the entirety of Darhoc, simply named pheter.

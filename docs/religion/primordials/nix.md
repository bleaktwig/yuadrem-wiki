# Nix
Nix is the god of Unity and the Cosmos.

Their body is the cosmos itself: everything that exists is borrowed, and must eventually be returned to them. They have never manifested themself to a creature in the planet, but are are generally portrayed as a bare-faced curassow, its feathers iridescent like oil on water.

On the world, Nix manifests in the form of a black, iridescent tar, which is commonly named nix. This tar is the mix of all things, and is produced whenever disparity is enforced upon reality, such as when an incantation is cast, a life is born, or an idea is thought.

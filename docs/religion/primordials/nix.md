# Nix
Nix is the god of Unity and the Cosmos. Their body is the cosmos: everything that exists is borrowed from them, and must eventually be returned. Too many portrayals of Nix exist, all equally as valid. Rather than an humanoid form, is that of a bare-faced curassow with iridescent feathers.

Nix manifests in Darhoc<!-- TODO. Link. --> as a black, iridescent tar, named nix. This tar is the mix of all things, and is produced whenever disparity is enforced upon what was something, such as when a sorcerer<!-- TODO. Link. --> consumes pheter<!-- TODO. Link. --> to produce incantatations.

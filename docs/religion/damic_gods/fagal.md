# Fagal
Fagal is the god of Dark and the Unknown, and their manifestation is the Nothing. They are the darksun, and are associated with death, beauty, darkness, oblivion, and property.

Thanks to Fagal there is saturation in color, as darkness gives value to a hue. They are often referred to as The Observer, portrayed as a dark figure cloaked in stars. Their representation is a colossal king vulture, their shadow blocking the light of the sun.

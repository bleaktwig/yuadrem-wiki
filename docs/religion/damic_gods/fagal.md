# Fagal
Fagal is the god of Black, Darkness, Mystery, Beauty, Oblivion, and Property.

Nothing is her incarnation, and she is commonly associated to private property. They are the darksun, providing darkness to the night and saturation to color. While the god doesn't usually appear on the planet, they seldom take the form of a king vulture, momentarily blocking the light of the sun with their colossal body.

Fagal sometimes appears to mortals on dreams, acting as portent of great change in one's life. In these opportunities, they appear as a dark, indistinct figure, cloaked in a mantle of stars.

# Zash
Zash is the goddess of White, Light, Luck, Beer, Travel, Immigrants, and Gifts.

Color is her incarnation, and she is often associated with acts of hospitality and of celebration. She is the sun, creator of Color, and mother to all [mevic gods](../index.md#mevic-gods). When her astral body is covered by clouds, the goddess takes the form of a great white egret, blinding those who see her with her shining white feathers.

Zash sometimes visits households during the darkest nights, taking an indistinct [hume](../../kins/hume.md) figure in traveler clothes. Refusing extending hospitality to her is a grave mistake—often the last one—for she meets hostility in-kind.

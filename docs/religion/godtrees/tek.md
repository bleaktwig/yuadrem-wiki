# Tek
Tek, or _Tekatsae_ in [knaenese](../../languages/index.md#naenkian-family), is the god-tree planted by [Matevos](../mevic_gods/matevos.md), and its the creator of the [elves](../../kins/elf.md).

The tree is an immense banyan that stands tall in the Drejek Plateau<!--TODO:LINK--->, shading most of the jungle there with an imposing array of innumerable green crowns. Its root system spreads through the entirety of the plateau, giving life to every tree, plant, and fungus in it.

During the [Penance](../../history.md#age-of-sap), Tek not only protected its jungle from nix, it used its immense root system to lift a significant portion of the terrain. Slow and deliberate, it dragged the plateau toward the Fesh Peninsula<!--TODO:LINK--->, creating the plateau that stands now between the Punika<!--TODO:LINK---> and the Puneui mountain ridges<!--TODO:LINK--->.

# Tek
Tek, or _Tekatsae_ in [Knaenese](../../languages/index.md#naenkian-family), is a colossal banyan standing tall in the Drejek Plateau<!-- TODO. Link? -->. It was planted by [Matevos](../mevic_gods/matevos.md), and is the parent of the [barkskin](../../kins/barkskin.md).

In oldentimes, its root system spread through the whole Drejek Jungle<!-- TODO. Link. -->, giving life to every tree and fungus in it. After The Penance<!-- TODO. Link. -->, Tek lifted a significant portion of the jungle terrain, and deliberately dragged it to the Fesh Peninsula<!-- TODO. Link. -->, creating the Drejek Plateau<!-- TODO. Link. --> that stands now between the Punika<!-- TODO. Link. --> and the Puneui mountain ridges<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

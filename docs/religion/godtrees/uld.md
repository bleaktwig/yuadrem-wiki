# Uld
Uld was the god-tree planted by [Fusine](../mevic_gods/fusine.md).

Uld was a purple kapok tree of breathtaking scale, whose purple crown shaded the entirety of the Everwoods<!--TODO:LINK--->, and turned its center into a swamp known as the Pale Blemish<!--TODO:LINK--->. While the god-tree didn't produce any progeny, it befriended a band of wandering [oths](../../kins/oth.md), who established the old library of Ignelli<!-- TODO. Link. --> on the labyrinthian passageways created by Uld's trunk and roots.

Along with the oths<!-- TODO. change with these oths' culture name when i have it. -->, the kapok tree invented the [uldian tree of languages](../../languages/index.md#uldian-tree), informing a deeply academic society. The goddess Fusine herself would come down every two months to Ignelli, visiting the oths and exchanging knowledge with them.

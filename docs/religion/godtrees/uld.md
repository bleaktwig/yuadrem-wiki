# Uld
Uld was the god-tree planted by [Fusine](../mevic_gods/fusine.md).

Uld was a purple kapok tree of breathtaking scale, whose purple crown shaded the entirety of the Everwoods<!--TODO:LINK--->, and turned its center into a swamp known as the Pale Blemish<!--TODO:LINK--->. While the god-tree didn't produce any progeny, it befriended a band of wandering [fey](../../kins/fay.md), who established the city-state of Ignelli<!--TODO:LINK---> on the labyrinthian passageways created by Uld's trunk and roots.

Along with the fey of Ignelli<!--TODO:LINK--->, the kapok tree invented the [uldian tree of languages](../../languages/index.md#uldian-tree), informing a deeply academic society. The goddess Fusine herself would come down every two months to Ignelli, visiting the fey and exchanging knowledge with them.

# Uld
Uld was a purple kapok of breathtaking size that stood in the middle of the Everforest<!-- TODO. LINK. --> until it was destroyed in the Tidal Sway<!-- TODO. LINK. -->. It was planted by the goddess [Fusine](../mevic_gods/fusine.md), who herself would sit atop the tree's branches every two month to watch upon the world.

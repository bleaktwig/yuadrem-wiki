# Ur
Ur was the god-tree planted by [Pagram](../mevic_gods/pagram.md), and did not produce any progeny.

It was a fir with a tall, single straight trunk. Its branches, which sprouted in whorls, were crowned by leaves that kept a golden color year-round, their light scattering in the misty fjords of [Stinos](../../geography/northern_territories.md#stinos). Every autumn it would shed its innumerable leaves, giving the land its unique gilded coloration, and was an essential part of its ecology.

# Tol
Tol was the smallest of the god-trees, and it sprouted from the stump of [Et](et.md) two centuries after the [Schism](../../history.md#war-of-autumn). The tree's fruit were the [fey](../../kins/fay.md), an initially enigmatic kin that later integrated into [gat](../../kins/hume.md#gat-culture) culture.

While it was a birch like its parent, Tol did not seem to have a relation with Blue, and its had a pattern and coloration similar to a moth's wing, rather than the blue of Et's bark and crowns. It was also much smaller is size, its circumference a mere hundred meter, and its crowns were of a sickly white color.

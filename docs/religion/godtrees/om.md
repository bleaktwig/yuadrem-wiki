# Om
Om, also known as _Tosh-drieln_ in jantherlin, is the godtree planted by the god [Bagrat](../mevic_gods/bagrat.md). It is a vigorous orange juniper, and its complex root system forms the many islands of the Turtle Sea<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

Before The Schism<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the tree fought with [Et](et.md) in the eternal War of Spring<!-- TODO. Link. -->, in which it created the [imates](../../kins/imate.md) to defend itself against the [humes](../../kins/hume.md). This creation came too late, however, as the children of Et managed to burn Om, marking the end of an era.

Seven centuries after being burned, the godtree has started growing again. Now, trees grow its eastern side's branches, creating modest crowns over the imate city of Thean<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

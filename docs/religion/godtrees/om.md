# Om
Om, also known as _Tosh-drieln_ in [Jantherlin](../../languages/index.md#etian-family) and the twice-born tree, is the god-tree planted by the god [Bagrat](../mevic_gods/bagrat.md) and the parent of the [imates](../../kins/imate.md).

The tree is a vigorous orange juniper with a complex root system that forms the many islands of the Turtle Sea<!-- TODO. Link. -->. While the tree burned down in the [Schism](../../history.md#war-of-autumn), it begat a second trunk from its eastern side over the centuries.

After the Lesser Omietian War<!-- TODO. Link. --> and the re-founding of the city of Thean<!-- TODO. Link. -->, Om's branches have begun to flaunt shy saffron crowns. These provide shade and the hope of a new future to the imates of the city, now finally back in their ancestral home.

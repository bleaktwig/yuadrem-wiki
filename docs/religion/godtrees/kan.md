# Kan
Kan was the god-tree planted by [Vahan](../mevic_gods/vahan.md), and did not produce any progeny.

It was a plant unique in the world: red branches extended upward atop hundreds of meters of a dark gray trunk, evoking the mountainous strength of the mevic god that planted it. The god-tree stood in the middle of Krejek<!--TODO:LINK--->, capturing thunder from the clouds and erupting into seasonal firestorms that defined the landscape of the rocky island.

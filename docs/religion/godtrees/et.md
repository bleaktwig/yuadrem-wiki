# Et
Et was the god-tree planted by [Febrid](../mevic_gods/febrid.md), and its fruit are the et-born<!-- TODO. Link. -->, whose progeny are the [humes](../../kins/hume.md).

The tree was a towering birch, its bark marked by deep blue indentations, and its leaves shining in different hues from ice to midnight colors. Its circumference was so great that, centuries after its death, the rim of its burnt stump became the outer wall of Naptane<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the capital of the Seven Protectorates of the Sea<!-- TODO. Link. -->. Some time after the citadel's foundation, a second birch sprouted from the burned stump—the god-tree [Tol](tol.md).

At the beginning of history, the trees Et and [Om](om.md) were locked in an eternal conflict known as the [War of Spring](../../history.md#war-of-spring), which concluded in the burning of Om at the hand of Et's children, the humes. [Pheter](../primordials/pheter.md), enraged, struck Et down with lightning, burning it together with its sibling god-tree.

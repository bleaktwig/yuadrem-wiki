# Et
Et was the tree of [Febrid](../mevic_gods/febrid.md). It was a towering blue birch. Et and [Om](om.md) were locked in an eternal conflict called the [War of Spring](../../history.md#war-of-spring), in which the godtree created the [humes](../../kins/hume.md). At the end of the war, Pheter struck Et with the fundamental signature of lightning<!-- TODO. Link. -->, an event known as the [Schism](../../history.md#war-of-spring) that marks the start of the [Age of Dark](../../history.md#dark-age).

Centuries after the death of the oric god, the rim of its burnt stump became the outer wall of Naptane<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the capital of the Seven Protectorates of the Sea<!-- TODO. Link. -->. Along this rim later sprouted a second godtree, [Tol](tol.md).

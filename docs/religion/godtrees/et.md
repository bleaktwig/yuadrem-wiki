# Et
Et was the tree of [Febrid](../mevic_gods/febrid.md). It was a towering blue birch. Et and [Om](om.md) were locked in an eternal conflict called the War of Spring<!-- TODO. Link. -->, in which the godtree created the [humes](../../kins/hume.md). At the end of the war, Pheter struck Et with the World Lightning<!-- TODO. Link. -->, an event known as The Schism<!-- TODO.

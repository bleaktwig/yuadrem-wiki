# Febrid
Febrid, sometimes named Nuagal, is the goddess of Blue, cold, and intellect. Her manifestation is wood, and is related to the stability of communities.

Febrid's representation is an azure jay, leaving a trail of dew in its path. When depicted as a [hume](../kins/hume.md), she is crowned by a pair of horns in the shape of a crescent moon, her body covered in apomantic tattoos.

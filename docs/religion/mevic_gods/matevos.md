# Matevos
Matevos is the goddess of Green, Lightness, Joy, and the Domestication of animals.

Water is her incarnation, and she is often associated to the essential needs of a person. The goddess often manifests to mortals in the shape of a grey-breasted parakeet, screaming in accusation of those who would deny others their means to survive. She sometimes takes the form of a [hume](../../kins/hume.md), appearing as a two-horned gat with light clothes, wielding a green bident with nimble expertise.

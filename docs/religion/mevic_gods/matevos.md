# Matevos
Matevos is the goddess of Green, lightness, and glory. Her manifestation is water, and she is often associated with the essential needs of a person.

Matevos' representation is a grey-breasted parakeet, screaming in accusation of those who profit over the needs of others. When portrayed as a [hume](../../kins/hume.md), she is often drawn with two large horns, holding a green bident in celebration.

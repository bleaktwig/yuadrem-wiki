# Fusine
Fusine, sometimes named Kegal, is the goddess of Purple, chaos, and the stars. Her manifestation is metal and lightning, and is associated with the resolution of conflicts, especially through combat.

Fusine's representation is a golden parakeet, her flight always followed by a storm. She's not often portrayed as a [hume](../../kins/hume.md)—but as a black-bellied slider turtle, whose shell shines with a million stars.

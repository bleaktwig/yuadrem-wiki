# Fusine
Fusine is the goddess of Purple, Chaos, the Stars, Retribution, and Thunder.

Metal is her incarnation, and she is associated with the resolution of conflicts, especially when done through combat. Like her sister [Febrid](febrid.md), Fusine doesn't often appear on the land; she's only been seen ephemerally as a swallow-tailed hummingbird, her flight followed by the passage of a terrible storm.

The goddess doesn't live in the Ring of Color<!-- TODO. Link. -->, but rather flies in the night sky as the moon Kegal. Fusine was tasked with the destruction of [Et](../godtrees/et.md) by [Pheter](../primordials/pheter.md) in the [Schism](../../history.md#war-of-spring), and her surface is marked with the etian signature of lightning the All-Storm.

In addition to her manifestation as a bird, she sometimes also appears to mortals on dreams, often before terrible natural disasters. In these occasions, she takes the form of a black-bellied slider turtle, her shell shining with a million stars.

# Vahan
Vahan is the god of Red, Heaviness, Mountains, and War.

Fire is his incarnation, and he is associated with the self-sufficiency of both people and communities. The mevic god appears often on Yuadrem as a scarlet ibis, scorching the earth wherever he steps, following the wake of wars and natural disasters. Vahan sometimes takes the form of a [hume](../../kins/hume.md), a red-haired soldier wearing a one-horned helm, wielding a large flanged mace with a firm grip.

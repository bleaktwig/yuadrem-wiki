# Bagrat
Bagrat is the god of Orange, Heat, Agriculture, Benevolence, Vigor, and Summer.

Earth is his incarnation, and he is associated with kindness, charity, and healthcare. He manifests to mortals frequently in the body of a campo troupial, blooming flowers and hasting the growth of crops. On occasion, he also takes the form of a horned [hume](../../kins/hume.md) with simple clothes, working the fields of a tired farmer with tools made of red gold.

# Pagram
Pagram is the god of Yellow, Order, Civilization, Gold, and Autumn.

Stone is his incarnation, and is celebrated in the formation of cities and their associated rituals. Pagram manifests as a golden parakeet, his fluttering following the flowers that decorate a city. He sometimes appears to scholars as a horned [hume](../../kins/hume.md) philosopher, wearing white clothing, pompously adorned in gold.

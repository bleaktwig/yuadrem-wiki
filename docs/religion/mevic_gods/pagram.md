# Pagram
Pagram is the god of Yellow, Order, Civilization, and Gold.

Stone is his incarnation, and is celebrated in the formation of cities and their associated rituals. Pagram manifests as a golden parakeet, his fluttering following the flowers that decorate a city. He sometimes appears to scholars as a horned [hume](../../kins/hume.md) philosopher, wearing white clothing, pompously adorned in gold.

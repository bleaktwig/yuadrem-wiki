# Tanethism
Old Tanethism was characterized by its myriad of gods—one for each apomantic signature<!-- NOTE. Link. -->. This religion was widely practiced in the Seven Protectorates<!-- NOTE. Link. --> and their various colonies up to the late [Age of Gold](../history.md#age-of-gold). However, this changed in the year 520 A.S., when the [god-suzerain Olag](illuminants/olag.md) established "new" Tanethism as the official religion of the protectorates.

The religion is based on a book published by Taneth in 311 A.S., in which the scholar and traveler wrote an exhaustive compilation of the more than a thousand deities praised in the region. In this taxonomy, they classified the similitudes and differences between most of these deities and proposed a reduced pantheon with a clear, tiered hierarchy between all of them.

While now considered a sacred scholar, Taneth's work was barely known during their life. They died shortly after the publication, and not many details of their life are known.

Many a hume has a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. A few even dedicate themselves entirely to a single deity, serving as a priest, acolyte, or champion of that god's manifestation. Some famous examples among these devotees are the Pagramic Nimrods, an organization of zealous hunters of [Pagram](mevic_gods/pagram.md) who would pursue all who disturb the perceived balance. Another example is the followers of Havetish, who to this date seek to distribute wealth and food to the impoverished inhabitants in the inland regions.

<!--Other religions do exist, but receive little attention in the modern world. Once widely practiced, the three most notorious ones are [Tsalemism](religions/tsalemism.md), [Igneism](religions/igneism.md), and [Cosmism](religions/cosmism.md).-->

## The Tanethist Pantheon
### The Two Primordial
The two primordial are the primal forces that created everything that exists. They are uppermost in the pantheon, and every creature in the continent acts in their reverence by the mere act of being alive.

* [**Nix**](primordials/nix.md), the god of Unity and the cosmos.
* [**Pheter**](primordials/pheter.md), the god of Disparity, creation, war, and spring.

### Damic Gods
The damic gods, or _first gods_ in [Avshenese](../languages/index.md#avshenesian-family), are the firstborn of Pheter. They were the first disparity in the cosmos, light and dark, and inhabit the heavens in the shape of the sun and the third moon, the darksun.

* [**Zash**](damic_gods/zash.md), the goddess of White, light, luck, beer, travel, immigrants, and gifts.
* [**Fagal**](damic_gods/fagal.md), the god of Black, darkness, mystery, beauty, oblivion, and property.

### Mevic Gods
The mevic gods, or _gods of bone_, are the six aspects of Zash, and were created by the sun goddess and by Pheter in the [_Nascency of Color_](../history.md#prehistory). Most of the gods inhabit their circular sectors in the Ring of Color<!-- NOTE. Link. -->, with the exception of Febrid and Fusine, who travel the cosmos alongside Zash and Fagal.

* [**Matevos**](mevic_gods/matevos.md), the goddess of Green, lightness, joy, and the domestication of animals.
* [**Febrid**](mevic_gods/febrid.md), or Nuagal, is the goddess of Blue, cold, intellect, time, and winter.
* [**Fusine**](mevic_gods/fusine.md), or Kegal, is the goddess of Purple, chaos, the stars, retribution, and thunder.
* [**Vahan**](mevic_gods/vahan.md) is the god of Red, heaviness, mountains, and war.
* [**Bagrat**](mevic_gods/bagrat.md) is the god of Orange, warmth, agriculture, benevolence, vigor, and summer.
* [**Pagram**](mevic_gods/pagram.md) is the god of Yellow, order, civilization, gold, and autumn.

### God-trees
The oric gods, or _gods of flesh_ in Avshenese, were the first trees in the world and are the creators of most living creatures in it. More commonly known as the _god-trees_, each was born of a seed during the [_First Communion_](../history.md#prehistory), planted by their corresponding mevic god. Despite being divine beings, they are physical, and thus, mortal. Regretfully, most of them have died, either in the [Schism](../history.md#war-of-spring) or in the [Penance](../history.md#age-of-tar).

* [**Tek**](godtrees/tek.md) is an immense banyan, shaded by imposing green crowns. It was planted by Matevos, and is the parent of the [barkskin](../kins/barkskin.md).
* [**Et**](godtrees/et.md) was a blue birch with many-hued leaves. It was planted by Febrid, and is the creator of the [humes](../kins/hume.md).
* [**Tol**](godtrees/tol.md) was another birch of a sickly white color. It sprouted from the burned stump of Et, and is the parent of [oths](../kins/oth.md).
* [**Uld**](godtrees/uld.md) was a kapok tree of striking height and a purple crown. It was the tree of Fusine, and created no kin but educated many.
* [**Kan**](godtrees/kan.md), a fire-starter tree unique in Yuadrem, was the tree of Vahan.
* [**Om**](godtrees/om.md) is a vigorous orange juniper with shy saffron crowns. It was the tree of Bagrat, and spawned and raised the [imates](../kins/imate.md).
* [**Ur**](godtrees/ur.md), a fir with countless golden crowns, was the tree of Pagram.

### Illuminants
The tovasic gods, or _second gods_ in Avshenese, are mortals who are given godhood by higher gods through a ritual of ascension. Better known as illuminants, they are usually protagonists of legends, becoming deities after death and watching over the world alongside the mevic gods from the heavens.

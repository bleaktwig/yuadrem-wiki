# Tanethism
Old Tanethism was characterized by its myriad of gods—one for each apomantic signature<!-- NOTE. Link. -->. This religion was widely practiced in the Seven Princedoms of the Sea<!-- NOTE. Link. --> and their various colonies up to the late [Age of Gold](../history.md#age-of-gold). However, in the year 520 A.S., by decree of the [god-suzerain Olag](illuminants/olag.md), a "new" Tanethism was established as the official religion of the princedoms. Today, this is the most practiced religion in the Fesh Peninsula<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

The religion is based on a book published by Taneth in 311 A.S., in which the scholar and traveler wrote an exhaustive compilation of the more than a thousand deities praised in the region. In this taxonomy, they classified the similitudes and differences between most of these deities and proposed a reduced pantheon with a clear, tiered hierarchy between all of them.

While now considered a sacred scholar, Taneth's work was barely known during their life. They died in obscurity shortly after the publication, and no detail about them remains on paper apart from their name.

Most people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. A few even dedicate themselves entirely to a single deity, serving as a priest, acolyte, or champion of that god. Some famous examples among these devotees are the Pagramic Nimrods, an organization of zealous hunters of [Pagram](mevic_gods/pagram.md) who would pursue all who disturb the perceived balance. Another example is the followers of [Havetish](#illuminants), who to this date seek to distribute wealth and food to the impoverished inhabitants in the inland regions.

<!--Other religions do exist, but receive little attention in the modern world. Once widely practiced, the three most notorious ones are [Tsalemism](religions/tsalemism.md), [Igneism](religions/igneism.md), and [Cosmism](religions/cosmism.md).-->

![The Cosmos](img/cosmos.y796_v100_dpi300.png)

_A first glance into the Cosmos and its relation to the goddesses and gods of Tanethism, 796 A.S.. Each of the divinities that inhabits the heavens is presented around Darhoc and the Ring of Color that surrounds it. Recorded by the Fremite Monastery of Chist._

## The Tanethist Pantheon
### The Two Primordial
The two primordial are the primal forces that created everything that exists. They are uppermost in the pantheon, and every creature in the continent acts in their reverence by the mere act of being alive.

* [**Nix**](primordials/nix.md), the god of Unity and the cosmos.
* [**Pheter**](primordials/pheter.md), the god of Disparity, creation, war, and spring.

### Damic Gods
The damic gods, or _first gods_ in [Avshenese](../languages/index.md#avshenesian-family), are the firstborn of Pheter. They were the first disparity in the cosmos, light and dark, and inhabit the heavens in the shape of the sun and the third moon, the darksun.

* [**Zash**](damic_gods/zash.md), the goddess of White, light, luck, beer, travel, immigrants, and gifts.
* [**Fagal**](damic_gods/fagal.md), the god of Black, darkness, mystery, beauty, oblivion, and property.

### Mevic Gods
The mevic gods, or _gods of bone_, are the six aspects of Zash, and were created by the sun goddess and by Pheter in the [_Nascency of Color_](../history.md#prehistory). Most of the gods inhabit their circular sectors in the Ring of Color<!-- NOTE. Link. -->, with the exception of Febrid and Fusine, who travel the cosmos alongside Zash and Fagal.

* [**Matevos**](mevic_gods/matevos.md), the goddess of Green, lightness, joy, and the domestication of animals.
* [**Febrid**](mevic_gods/febrid.md), or Nuagal, is the goddess of Blue, cold, intellect, time, and winter.
* [**Fusine**](mevic_gods/fusine.md), or Kegal, is the goddess of Purple, chaos, the stars, retribution, and thunder.
* [**Vahan**](mevic_gods/vahan.md) is the god of Red, heaviness, mountains, and conflict.
* [**Bagrat**](mevic_gods/bagrat.md) is the god of Orange, warmth, agriculture, benevolence, vigor, and summer.
* [**Pagram**](mevic_gods/pagram.md) is the god of Yellow, order, civilization, gold, and autumn.

### God-trees
The oric gods, or _gods of flesh_ in Avshenese, were the first trees in the world and are the creators of most living creatures in it. More commonly known as the _god-trees_, each was born of a seed during the [_First Communion_](../history.md#prehistory), planted by their corresponding mevic god. Despite being divine beings, they are physical, and thus, mortal. Regretfully, most of them have died, either in the [Schism](../history.md#war-of-spring) or in the [Penance](../history.md#age-of-tar).

* [**Tek**](godtrees/tek.md) is an immense banyan, shaded by imposing green crowns. It was planted by Matevos, and is the parent of the [barkskin](../kins/barkskin.md).
* [**Et**](godtrees/et.md) was a blue birch with many-hued leaves. It was planted by Febrid, and is the creator of the [humes](../kins/hume.md).
* [**Tol**](godtrees/tol.md) was another birch of a sickly white color. It sprouted from the burned stump of Et, and is the parent of [oths](../kins/oth.md).
* [**Uld**](godtrees/uld.md) was a kapok tree of striking height and a purple crown. It was the tree of Fusine, and created no kin but educated many.
* [**Kan**](godtrees/kan.md), a fire-starter tree unique in Yuadrem, was the tree of Vahan.
* [**Om**](godtrees/om.md) is a vigorous orange juniper with shy saffron crowns. It was the tree of Bagrat, and spawned and raised the [imates](../kins/imate.md).
* [**Ur**](godtrees/ur.md), a fir with countless golden crowns, was the tree of Pagram.

### Illuminants
The tovasic gods, or _second gods_ in Avshenese, are mortals who are given godhood by higher gods through a ritual of ascension. Better known as illuminants, they are usually protagonists of legends, becoming deities after death and watching over the world alongside the mevic gods from the heavens.

* **Avenush** is the god of teaching and tactics. As a mortal, they were a [barkskin](../kins/barkskin.md) who mediated the peace between Gannag and the Seven Princedoms, then proceeded to create the gannagian apomantic system<!-- NOTE. Link. -->. They were ascended by Febrid, and their depictions show a body covered entirely by a most complex network of apomantic signatures, a glyph carved into each centimeter of bark.

* **Eful** and **Geful** are the goddesses of justice, the sky, knowledge, and love. As mortals, they were two [oths](../kins/oth.md) scholars who provided the basis for modern math and astrology. They were both ascended together by Fusine, and upon achieving godhood jumped to the heavens to continue their studies, becoming the twin astral bodies known as Relas.

* **Elña** is the goddess of tradition and forests. She was the "immortal" queen of the kingdom of Gronselar<!-- TODO. Link. --> in the far south of the world. She was ascended by Pagram, and often takes the shape of a white deer, watching of the descendants of the gronselarian irds, who she still takes under her care.

* **Havetish** is the god of both leadership and tyranny. Their mortal name was Qina, and were the [barskin](../kins/barkskin.md) warlord who led their kin against the [imates](../kins/imate.md) in the Babanian Wars<!-- NOTE. Link. -->. They were ascended by the god of conflict Vahan, and are depicted with a bark and a spear carved from purpleheart wood.

* **Laver**, sometimes known as Gathoz, is the god of secrecy and murder. While their name in life is unknown, they are the assassin who battled and killed the god-suzerain Olag using Tetrachromacy<!-- NOTE. Link. -->. Now, they are often attributed to murders where the perpetrator is never found. They were ascended by Fusine during the night of the murder, and are depicted as a kinless being, their face and body shifting under rags. Due to their great sin, they were not allowed into the Ring of Color, and thus now orbits the heavens as an astral body.

* **Mziva** is the god of self-sacrifice. As a mortal, she was an [imate](../kins/imate.md) who led her people to salvation during the [Ededian Genocide](../history.md#war-of-spring), at the cost of her own life. She was ascended by Tamaz, and is depicted with golden hair and clothes made of flowers.

* **Nikoleta**, also known as Bades, is the goddess of rituals and sorcery. As a mortal, she was a [gat](../kins/hume.md#gat-culture) sorceress from Fremit<!-- TODO. Link. --> and a scholar of Nix. She created an incantation that temporarily stops the spread of nix, and cast it atop Mount Tashta to stop the tar from invading the Fesh Peninsula. The ritual killed her, but was ascended by Febrid upon death. Her incantation is repeated every year in various parts of the Punika Ridge<!-- TODO. Link. --> to continue protecting the peninsula. She ascended to the heavens after death, and became the astral body Bades.

* [**Olag**](illuminants/olag.md) is the god of craftsmanship and conquest. They were the first of the illuminants, and the god-suzerain of the Seven Princedoms of the Sea<!-- TODO. Link. -->. They were an Et-born who ascended by Vahan's will in 195 A.S. and died in 621 A.S..

* **Rerisi**, or sometimes known as Zuleija, is the goddess of discipline and protection. She was a treb gat who fought back against the beasts of the Sylvan Canyon<!-- TODO. Link. -->, allowing for the establishment of the city-states of Viphoger<!-- TODO. Link. -->. She was ascended by Vahan for her strength, and is depicted with weapons and armor made of heavy stone. She soared to the heavens after her death, and is now the furthest astral body from Darhoc.

* **Sakris** is the god of fun and wine. As a mortal, he was the most devoted slave to the prince-merchant Hak of Ushpavam<!-- NOTE. Link. -->. Ascended by Matevos, he is often depicted dutifully attending to guests at a party, even as a god.

| _Etian signature of Rerisi._                             |

* **Tamaz** is the goddess of wealth and silver. As a mortal, she was an [ird](../kins/hume.md#ird-culture) adventurer, known for financing the first colonial ships of Krudzal<!-- TODO. Link? -->. She is now depicted in a shiny gray dress, holding an iron hammer and a woodworking saw, and was ascended by the god of civilization, Pagram.

* **Tinos**, sometimes known as Genadi, is the goddess of bravery and compassion. As a mortal, she was an [imate](../kins/imate.md) hero whose acts led to the death of King D'khan, ending the [Ededian Genocide](../history.md#war-of-spring). She was ascended by Bagrat, and is depicted with toad-like features, carrying her characteristic swordflute. She rose to the heavens after death, and now wards her fellow imates as an astral body.

* **Vugar** is the god of family and generosity. As a mortal, he was the protected prince of the kingdom of Vamerit<!-- TODO. Link. --> and was renowned for establishing laws pertaining to family and hereditary rights to the Seven Princedoms<!-- NOTE. Link. -->. He was ascended by Bagrat, and is often depicted with a silver toga of simple style.

As far as is known, there exist only four illuminants alive in the Fesh Peninsula at the current date. Skepticism is encouraged, however, as mevic gods have performed many ascensions surreptitiously, with the echelon of the new god only divulged years later, sometimes posthumously.

* **Anush**, also known as Doran, is the god of rot and fertility. They are a barkskin born outside the reach of Tek, and thus unable to commune with the god-tree. Rather than becoming feral, like their kin in Knagan<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the illuminant didn't let their birth become a weakness, and now spreads tekust spores<!-- TODO. Link. --> and assists in funerary rituals across the Fesh Peninsula. They were recently ascended by Bagrat, which has only emboldened their spirit and that of their followers.

* **Do Zazuzu** is the god of mischief and pageants. He is an oras imate<!-- TODO. Link. --> famous for his role in the independence of Viphoger and his graceful antics. He was ascended by the god of joy Matevos, and now runs a traveling company of troubadours and acrobats that performs all around the Fesh Peninsula.

* **Jirek** is the god of might and salt. He is a treb gat<!--TODO. Link. --> that was ascended by Vahan after he beat and killed the god's previous champion, Rerisi. The illuminant is now one of the chiefs of Nalash, and lives in the Ruti mountains waiting for challengers to try and take his title.

* **Vakris** is the god of madness and scavengers. He is a dratl ird<!-- TODO. Link. --> who was the leader of an infamous band of bandits in the Idul Ridge<!-- TODO. Link. --> before being captured by Vawe, the Regent Prince of Ushpavam<!-- TODO. Link. -->. He was exiled after having his group slaughtered and his body disfigured through torture, yet was later ascended in a perverse act of kindness by the goddess of retribution Fusine. He now roams the ridge readying his vengeance, while madly striking any who approach him.

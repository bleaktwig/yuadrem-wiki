\textit{There be cities grander than any of gat's make, holdin' creatures stranger than the harrowing immensity isself.
There be ungodly abominations that weren't never meant to see the light o' day.
And there be... there be mushrooms! An entire city of mushrooms!}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Blim, the Na'anian chronicles.

% Apart from its chief, every unit has a designated tsanek shaman.
% This tsanek is mainly in charge of communicating with the other tsaneks in faraway places, aiding in the coordination of the tribe as a whole.
% Apart from this and other ceremonial tasks, the shaman acts as a normal member of the unit.

% The highest ranking members of their society are the sovereigns and elder sovereigns, who are tsaneks that reached their final stage of development.
% The former are huge mobile tsaneks that take root in strategic positions in Drejeck to establish their complex communication network.
% The latter are the eldest in the tribe, and merge with Tekatsae itself.
% They directly speak to the tree, communicating its wishes to the sovereigns and shamans via their root network.

Also known as tsaneks in the naenk tongue, the fungal kin is a species of intelligent fungi creature that inhabit swamps, forests, and caverns.
They are commonly seen in the jungle of Drejeck, as members of the tribes near the tekatsae tree.
Like the naenks, tsaneks grow from the tree itself, starting out as small russet-colored fungi in the tree's base and exposed roots, until they're able to grow legs and emerge.
Unlike the naenks, the fungal kin are capable of reproducing by themselves, and it's very common to find independent tsanek communities in the darker reaches of Yuadrem.

Tsaneks generally deplore violence, and only attack when provoked.
If approached peacefully, they gladly provide shelter or passage through their colonies.

\subsection*{Tribal Life}
    Most tsaneks belong to the tribes of Drejeck, filling the roles of shamans and diplomats that the naenks are less likely to fulfill due to their violent nature.
    They are considered above their mossy companions in their social circles, and are generally treated with respect among them.

    When a tsanek reaches 100 years, it is put through the rite of growth.
    The tsanek must ceremoniously consume a mixture of the sap of tekatsae, wyvernroot, and water of the boiling river. % Wyvernroot is a strong poisonous plant native to Drejeck.
    Next, it must enter a chamber of awareness, which are small caverns below tekatsae.
    The tsanek is only left out after a month in isolation.
    Most of the tsaneks that go through this ritual die, and are consumed by tekatsae, bringing them back to the tree.
    The ones that don't become the highest ranking members of their tribal societies: Sovereigns.
    Tsanek sovereigns are large, malformed creatures that reign over the tribes.
    They are the only creatures capable of directly speaking with tekatsae, and thus are the only that can communicate its wishes to the tribes.

\subsection*{Circles and Melds}
    Many tsaneks, feeling unprepared, leave the tribes before this ritual.
    Usually many more of their species follow them to start independent communities as exiles.
    Over a timeframe of 300 to 400 years, the eldest from these colonies naturally grow to become sovereigns themselves, presiding over many social groups called circles.
    A circle consists of twenty or more fungal kin that work, live, and meld together.

    Melding is prohibited in the Drejeck tribal communities, but is a regular practice in these circles.
    A meld is a form of communal meditation that allows tsaneks to transcend their sometimes dull existence.
    Their rapport spores bind the participants into a group consciousness, inducing a shared dream that provides entertainment and social interaction.
    Tsaneks use melding in the pursuit of higher consciousness, collective union, and spiritual apotheosis.
    They can also use their rapport spores to communicate telepathically with other sentient creatures.

\subsection*{Tsanek Reproduction}
    Like other fungi, tsanek reproduce by mundane sporing.
    They are the only race that can retain their sentience without qualar, but if their spores grow without the influence of tekatsae or a particularly old sovereign, the sprouting quickly becomes feral, unable to retain sentience.
    Due to this, tsaneks carefully control their spores' release.

    Tsaneks are known to feel very little connection to their offspring.
    Among the tribal tsaneks, the children of their species are taken care of by a few tsanek designated as the spore-caretakers.
    Among the exiles, child rearing becomes a responsibility shared by the entire circle.
    It is rare if young tsaneks can even identify their parents.

\subsection*{Call to Adventure}
    While many tsanek are needed in the tribes near tekatsae for managerial tasks, it is not unusual for some to travel the globe to learn.
    Most focus their study on the qualar and cter'rheth, bringing this knowledge back to their tribes.

    Cavern tsaneks regularly travel the many caves below Yuadrem, and some even settle outside of their colonies, most usually in dark gat cities.
    Some have founded libraries, laboratories, and monasteries, usually along oths, and dedicate their lives to research and education.

\subsection*{Tsanek Names}
    Due to the fact that tsaneks have no verbal language, their names are most appropriately translated as physical descriptions of a particular individual.

    \paragraph{Names}
    Bolete, Brownback, Buttonhead, Greenfoot, Morel, Mossy, Portabelt, Puffball, Redstem, Soft-Step, Stinkhorn, Toad.

    \subparagraph{Alignment} Most often, a tsanek believes strongly in society and law.
    It is extremely uncommon for a tsanek to directly attack any creature that does not mean it, or its circle, harm.

\subsubsection{Gannagian Tsanek}
    Fungal kin that are members of the tribes in Drejeck which surround tekatsae.
    Like their mold kin brothers, they have a very strong sense of community and devotion to their groups, the sovereigns and the tekatsae tree.

    Other creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw of a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier or become poisoned for 1 minute.
    A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect early on itself on a success.
    When the effect ends, the creature gains one level of exhaustion.
    You can produce these spores a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per long rest.

\subsubsection{Na'anian Tsanek}
    Sometimes, a tsanek will decide to abandon the tribe and break its link with the tekatsae tree.
    These tsanek, unable to forgo their community lifestyles, tend to join or form fungus kin communities in the caverns of the world, sometimes spawning huge underground fungus cities.

    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Your meandering in hostile environments has granted you increased resilience, and your Constitution score is increased by 1.

    This conditions ends when you spend 1 minute in dim or dark conditions.

    \subparagraph{Superior Darkvision} Accustomed to the darkness of the deepest of caverns, you have superior darkvision in dark and dim conditions.
    You can see in dim light within 24 meters of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

    \subparagraph{Meld} \label{kin::tsanek.meld}
    When you take a short rest in the presence of one or more other tsaneks, you can meld with them.
    After melding, you and all melding tsaneks regain all expended Hit Dice and gain the following benefits:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You have advantage on a saving throw you make in the next 24 hours.
        \item You can end one disease or condition affecting you, be it blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
    \end{itemize}

    \subparagraph{Communal Intellect} Your time spent melding with the others of your kin has granted you a deeper understanding of the world and yourself.
    You are competent in the Insight and Religion skills, and you have advantage on Wisdom (survival) checks made to find your way in caverns.

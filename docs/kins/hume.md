# Humes
Et created humes to aid the oric god in the War of Spring.
Despite this, many opposed the conflict, or felt indifferent to it.
They fled the company of their god-tree, for which they were cursed with feathers.
They came to be known as irds, and this dispersion came to be known as the Ird Diaspora.
<!-- NOTE. This led to the first siege of Ctereth, where four different ird chiefdoms (led by 4 historic figures) stole qualars to allow their kin to travel away from Naptane. -->
The humes that remained with Et were blessed with horns, and are known as gats.
<!-- NOTE. Maybe mention what ird and gat mean in jantherlin? That might help integrate the language into the lore. -->

---
## Physical Description
Humes are of a broad spectrum.
Before the penance, humes traveled the entirety of Yuadrem, and they are as varied as the environments they settled.
Their height usually varies from slightly more than a meter to about 2.
They can weigh anything from 40 to 120 kg.
Their skin shades to any color from the darkest brown to the lightest hues.
They can grow long hair from their scalps and faces, with a great variety of color and thickness.

While this varies from culture to culture, in general a hume is considered an adult between 14 and 16 years.
Due to high child mortality, life expectancy averages to 25 years.
For those who reach that age, they have a reasonable chance of reaching 50 to 60 years.
Sorcerers are well known for extending their lives, and it is not unusual for them to live even more than a century.
<!-- NOTE. The downside of this are all the negative effects of Pheter use in the body, Nix sickness, deformed bodies + strange appendages, etc. -->

Humes are a gendered kin, and usually have one child at a time.
Previous to the Schism, childcare was left to the women of the families, in particular to each child's mother.
This varies among cultures, and communal childcare is the norm after the Penance.

---
## Gat Culture
### Distinctive Characteristics
The skin of a gat is generally dark, usually ranging from yellow, through brown, to black.
While some gats are blonde, the most common hair colors and brown, black, and sometimes red.
It is a common gat custom to sport long hair and beards, often decorated with jewelry.

With the exception of the treb, gats are generally small, ranging from 140 to 170 centimeters on average.
Another common feature accross gats is their eyes; which are usually of strong colors.
This feature is often attributed as a blessing of Color given by Et.

While all original gats had horns, the feature has been lost through the centuries.
Those birthed by the remains of the god-tree, or Et-born, retain the horns.
Yet they are increasingly rare after the Penance, as nix has destroyed the land that surrounds the tree.
<!-- TODO. At some point I need to describe what an Et-born gat is. -->
<!-- NOTE. Maybe describe what noves, bughna, and treb mean in Jantherlin/Old Avshenese. -->

<!-- NOTE. Tale of the gestation of an et-born.
    Gats are genderless creatures.
    All gats are born with a pair of seeds hidden in a small sack between their legs.
    Around the age of 30, a gat reaches physical maturity.
    This is signalled by a slight swelling in these seeds, which they can now cut and plant under a thick layer of rich soil.

    While underground, the seed will grow by leeching nutrients off the earth.
    After a gestation period of around 2 years, the gat will dig their way up from the ground and emerge as a somewhat competent infant.
    A gat would-be-parent must always be careful about where to plant their seed, for if a newborn sees the sun or any strong light during their first days, they run the risk of being permanently blinded.

    TODO. This clearly requires an update -- gats are now humes.
-->

<!-- TODO. Clothing. --->

### Origins and History
<!-- NOTE. Those who sided with Et. Et-born families still retain horns (by feeding the mother Et's sap), which were first gifted by Et to their loyal soldiers. -->
After the Schism, the surviving gats separated into three groups: noves, bughna, and treb.
Those who remained became known as noves gats, and their ethnicity is the most common in the modern world.
They built the holy city of Naptane inside the stump of Et, from which sprung the Seven Principates of the Sea.
Noves are often considered simile to civilization.

Bughna gats endured the 40-Year Famine by adopting a nomadic lifestyle, one which defines them still.
These humes became known as great pastors and merchants.
They strenghtened the bond between the principates, in part allowing the establishment of the large gat civilization.
Even today they are often associated to good luck.

Not all progeny of Et was born equal, and the treb are the perfect example.
They are larger and bulkier than the average hume, and were often the first line of attack in the War of Spring.
Treb gats were regarded as brutish, and didn't fit the civilization built by the noves.
They were exiled by Olag during the second century, and most established a new home in the Dead Sea.
<!-- NOTE. Treb gats are not *born* brutish. While their culture may seem "violent", they are very religious and show a sophistication with nature that is not commonly seen in other humes. -->

### Traditions and Religion
<!-- NOTE. Noves culture has its members remain at home a lot. Either lean into this or figure out more collective celebrations. -->
**Families and Guilds.**
To the noves, a family is defined as the group of people with which one shares housing.
Most members of a family share a profession, and large families are known as guilds.
The head of a family is either its oldest member or someone designated by them.

When a child is born, they become a member of the mother's family.
Most children know who their parents are, but childcare is a communal endeavor.
<!-- NOTE. Many members of a child's family have an important role in their development, and a special place in their heart :). -->
From their 14th birthday onward, a gat can choose to join another family.
They need to be accepted by the head of the receiving family.
The departure is often accompanied by a ceremonial feast shared by the two families.

**Death.**
Accross gat culture, the dead are said to protect their families after their death.
The old tradition is to bury the dead below the family house, especially under doors and windows.
Being below their loved ones aids the dead in their protection.
<!-- NOTE. The pheter in the bones of the dead literally aids the family by keeping nix out, but this effect is minor. -->

After the Penance, it has become common to burn some of the dead at the center of towns and villages.
This helps in staving off nix, as the charred bones release their pheter.
The specific tradition is chosen by the family, but burnings are commonly mandated when nix is on high tide.
<!-- NOTE. On the death of royalty. Kings and the royal family are burned after death. After that, their bones are placed on a giant mausoleum, all mixed together to accumulate their pheter. -->
<!-- NOTE. I could play more with nix tides. Maybe relate them to the moons? -->

**Bughna moon rituals.**
The bughna have a special admiration towards Kegal, the indigo moon.
In particular, the nomadic patterns of animal herders are aligned to the moon phases.
The search for new grazing grounds only occurs while the Kegalian world signature is in phase.
Bughna gats feel protected by the signature's gaze.
<!-- NOTE. Bughna also celebrate thunderstorms as portents of Kegal. -->
<!-- NOTE. Kegal is the moon with an stupid-large apomantic signature etched to its face. It's a very complex signature, used by Pheter to conduct lightning to Et. -->

**Aversion to piercing.**
One thing in common accross all gats is their aversion to piercing weapons, especially after the Penance.
Puncture wounds are believed to cause an excessive leakage of pheter.
This means that not only the victim's body is damage, but some of their soul leaks as well.
For this reason, gravely piercing another hume is punished by death.
<!-- NOTE. The soul is the pheter stored in a body. -->
<!-- NOTE. Olag punished traitors by impaling them in pikes, but without crossing major organs (idk how tho?). Then, not only did they bleed slowly, but they could feel their soul leaking away. -->

**Religion.**
Tanethism is the most common religion in Yuadrem.
It is the most common belief of all gats since the fifth century. <!-- TODO. This year might change soon!!!! -->
Despise its popularity, Tanethism is a personal religion.
Altars to certain gods are common, but established institutions to them are a rare sight, and is even prohibited in some provinces.

Apart from providing the list and description of the religion's gods, the book of Taneth details the myriad of rituals to each of them.
Most gats have a predilection toward certain gods, and include some of them into daily life.
Treb are particularly religious.
Often liturgy is attached to any activity an individual deems important.

### Names
In tradition, gats have various names.
These names don't have a particular order, and many can change during a gat's lifetime.
In addition, different people and communities will often know a gat by different names.
Names are not officialized, and the duty of recording individuals is left to each family.

While the intricacies of these names are unique to each community -- and sometimes a particular family --, five categories are common.

* A **personal name** is the name given to a gat my their mother, usually soon after birth.
Personal names are often permanent, but nothing stops a gat from changing them.
* A **parent name** is the name of a gat's mother or father followed by the suffix *ban*, meaning "sibling of" in avshenese.
A gat may prefer to use this name if a parent was particularly important.
Furthermore, additional parent names can be added after the first, climbing up a branch of the family tree.
* A **profession name** is simply the name of the profession practiced by the gat.
* A **family name**, which is acquired by all members of a family upon joining.
Sometimes, the head of the family will add the *grit* suffix to the family name, meaning "head" in avshenese.
* A **locality name** that comes from where the gat comes from, adding the *she* prefix, a phoneme associated to location in avshenese.
These names are acquired only by travelers, and depend on the extensions of their travels.
For example, a gat coming from a different town may be referred to by the name of that town, and one from another province will acquire its name.

Personal names are often easy to pronounce.
A non-exhaustive list of common ones is:
Adrevik, Ani, Anush, Armen, Avag, Gagik, Garen, Gevog, Gohar, Grigor, Hak, Harig, Hovsep, Jirar, Kevon, Khadzak, Marim, Narek, Pagran, Poghos, Ruben, Sivadr, Sona, Vahagn, Vefan.

<!-- NOTE. On names.
    * Oths hate the many names convention - organizing family trees and keeping track of historic figures is a total pain.
    * "Personal name" "parent name" "profession name" "family name" "locality name" "greatest achievement name (sometimes)".
    * Names are neither official nor recorded, but presenting yourself with a name that contains a lie is very badly seen, and may even be punished in some ethnic groups.
    * Just knowing someone's full name gives you a lot of information on that person.
-->

## Ird Culture
<!-- NOTE. Those who refused the War of Spring, sieged Ctereth and diaspora'd the fuck out of Naptane. They are said to have been cursed with feathers by Et (since they "fled"). Qulbaba irds wore a lot of colourful feathers, which lends to the confusion. -->

### Distinctive Characteristics
Irds are usually easy to recognize due to their size, which on average is about 175 centimeters.
Their skin color varies greatly, usually matching they environment they live in.
Their eye color is also assorted, yet are often less saturated than that of a gat.

Qulbaba and dratl irds are rather slender, while the thulkraka are generally broad.
Hair color is also a feature commonly used to determine the ethnicity of an ird.
Thulkraka irds often have either blonde, black, or ginger hair.
Then, the qulbaba have brown hair, usually in dark shades.
Dratl irds have light brown or orange hair, which tends to gray at an earlier age than other humes.

<!-- TODO. Clothing -->
Irds were said to have been cursed with feathers when they fled the War of Spring.
While they don't actually grow feathers, a common feature in ird attire is the usage of plumage in their clothing.
Before the Penance, the color of their clothing depended on their ethnicity.
Now, colorful feathers are usually only used in traditional rituals, as most fear the effect the colors may have on their bodies.

\section{Winged Kin} \label{kin::ird}
\DndDropCapLine{Y}{es, sure, you can create a machine to}
\textit{glide.
You can even ride a creature to stay aloft.
But you will never truly fly.
No kin can tame the sky with such grace as the irds.
Trust me, if they weren't so humble as to live among us, constrained to the ground, we'd be building temples to venerate their graciousness.}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Josiah, priest from the church of Rhekesh.

Sequestered in high mountains, deep jungles, and hot deserts, the irds, sisz rlue, or winged kin are known to survive some of the harshest environments all around Yuadrem.

\subsection*{Sky Wardens}
    Nowhere are the irds more comfortable than in the sky.
    They can spend hours in the air, and some go as long as days, locking their wings in place and letting the thermals hold them aloft.
    In battle, they prove dynamic and acrobatic fliers, moving with remarkable speed and grace, diving to lash opponents with weapons or talons before turning and flying away.

    Once airborne, an ird leaves the sky with reluctance.
    They sometimes forget or ignore vertical distances, and they have nothing but pity for those earthbound kins forced to live and toil constrained to the ground.

    The ird are a tribal species, and its rare for a tribe to hold more than a hundred irds at once.
    The only exceptions to this rule are the Krudzal and Kaldrathal, both large countries in the northern reaches of Yuadrem.
    They are welcoming to traders and visitors in general, but generally don't allow members from other kins to be permanent residents within their territory, and frown upon guests who overstay their welcome.

    Once tribes of irds settle in an area, they share a hunting territory that extends across an area up to 150 km on a side, with each tribe hunting in the lands nearest to their colony, ranging farther should game become scarce.
    A typical colony consists of one large, open-roofed nest made of woven vines.
    The eldest acts as leader with the support of a shaman.

\subsection*{Avian Mannerisms}
    The resemblance of ird to birds isn't limited to physical features.
    Irds display many of the same mannerisms as ordinary birds.
    They are fastidious about their plumage, frequently tending their feathers, cleaning and scratching away any tiny passengers they might have picked up.
    When they deign to descend from the sky, they often do so near pools where they can catch fish and bathe themselves.
    Even when perched on a high branch or at rest in their mountaintop homes, they appear alert, with eyes moving and bodies ready to take flight.

    Many winged kin punctuate their speech with chirps, sounds they use to convey emphasis and to shade meaning.
    An ird might become frustrated with people who fail to pick up on the nuances; an ird's threat might be taken as a jest and vice versa.
    Confinement terrifies the winged kin.
    To be imprisoned by the cold, unyielding earth is a torment few ird can withstand.

\subsection*{Innate Curiosity}
    Irds are naturally curious which, summed with their freedom of movement, leads to them being the ideal explorers and adventurers.
    They use their large wings to travel to almost any place in the entirety of Yuadrem, and as such they've become a common sight in all its reaches.
    Outside of their tribes, irds do enjoy living within other civilizations, and its rare to see a city or large settlement without at least one ird inhabitant.

    % Winged kin tribes are accepting of their members leaving for indefinite amounts of time, and this is even encouraged in many communities.
    % In fact, the population of a tribe is ever-changing, with the only constants being the eldest members and the shaman.
    % This means that neighboring tribes have strong and healthy relations, each coming to aid the ones in need without question.
    % Another consequence of their tendency to travel is the versatility of ird artisans, who integrate techniques from all around Yuadrem into their craft.

\subsection*{Ird Names}
    Ird names separate into two main categories.
    The first resemble their original language, Harualish, and include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other kins have a difficult time pronouncing them.
    When interacting with other races, they may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.

    On the other hands, irds from Krudzal, Kaldrathal, and other civilized lands tend to speak Shanise.
    Shanise is a language formed from the interaction of Harualish-speaking irds and Avshenese-speaking gats in the north.

    An ird last name is usually simply ``son/daughter of'' followed by one of their parent's name.
    Most irds admire their parents, and wear their last names with pride.

    \paragraph{Harualish Ird Names}
    Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, Zeed.

\subsubsection{Dratl Ird}
    Irds from the Dratl houses are known as ruthless ruffians, and are pariahs to the other winged kin subspecies.
    They are known for constantly harassing the other ird tribes, as well as any who approach their territory.
    The are collectively banned from entering any tribe from the other subspecies, and are usually unwelcome in towns and cities due to their bad reputation.

    Nowadays, Dratl houses are scattered around the Zoedrem desert, mostly unorganized.
    These are the remnants of the once great empire of Hulnar, disbanded in 591 AS.
    Despite their lost grandness, they are still feared by the common people, and continue to fiercely protect their hunting grounds.

    A Dratl ird's beak resembles that of a vulture, and their feathers are generally black, white, and red.

## Geographic Distribution
**TODO.**

<!-- TODO. Draw a map of the movement of humes out of Naptane and mark large population centers. Clearly separate gats and irds with two different colors. Focus on how the irds spread to all the land (specially after the boats of Krudzal), and gats mostly remained near Naptane and Jan'krug. -->

\section{Nomad Kin} \label{kin::uman}
\DndDropCapLine{O}{utsiders, the lot of them. Dragged}
\textit{into our world by an unnatural pull, ever unable to find stable footing.
No matter how much they beg and cry, do not allow them into your home.
Touched by a strange flame, whose brightness attracts equally as strange beasts into your door, into your hearth.
Get rid of them before they share their misfortune with you.}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Abneh, renowned nimrod.

Brought into this world with the Schism, the nomad kin are a strange race from Nyx.
Also known as umans, they have almost hairless bodies, and are similar in appearance to apes.

For an unknown reason, umans attract all kinds of predators from these lands.
Additionally, their blood has similar properties to the tall ones', and is used in many rituals.
Because of these reasons, umans are dispersed all around the world, and are nomadic in nature.

\subsection*{Accursed Coldblood} TODO. Maybe include the concept of coldblood in the "new" Yuadrem. Perhaps the blood of a certain breed of humes is actually better than average at keeping pheter - even better than oil. Actually, in general blood being better than oil at keeping Pheter is an interesting concept by itself!
    Known as coldblood due to its cerulean tint, Umans' blood has special properties, and is very useful for spellcasters.
    It retains a sort of energy, and can be used as a source of spells.
    Umans know this, and regularly prepare blood vials for trade and to strengthen troupes' wizards.

    Umans pay dearly for this special blood, as it acts as a beacon for the predators from Nyx, the Nyxborn.
    These creatures hunt umans, and many of the kin are banned from villages for safety concerns.

    Spellcasters seek coldblood, and many try to attain it by any means available.
    Naturally, the murder of umans for their blood is illegal in most nations, but some carry the custom on nevertheless.
    The nimrods are a cult that specializes in gathering coldblood via any means available, and are commonly contracted by wizards and warlocks to attain the product.

\subsection*{Adaptable and Durable}
    Hunted by both beast and kin, umans have trouble trusting others and don't normally settle in communities of other kins.
    They live in troupes exclusive to their kin, where usually all members have some familiar relationship.
    Troupes travel together and care for each other, assigning specific roles to each member based on their skills.

    Far from vulnerable, most troupes are fierce and resilient, hardened by centuries of being preyed upon.
    Groups keep track of how they are treated by different cities and towns, and only do commerce where they are accepted.

    While uncommon, some uman communities have managed to settle in one place.
    These communities keep their locations secret, communicating it only to other umans via traveler's cant, a set of writings and symbols they brought from Nyx.

\subsection*{Life in Escapade}
    For a uman, a life of adventure is not a romantic desire but rather a fact of mundane life.
    Used to the hardships of survival, a uman is especially capable of fending off threats and surpassing hardships.

    It is very common to see lone uman adventurers, either as exiles or in a quest for their troupe.
    Whatever the motive, they naturally excel at voyages, and are a great fit on any adventuring party.

\subsection*{Uman Names}
    Umans most commonly wear names from other cultures.
    Even in Nyx, umans were known to have a great variety of names depending on each specific culture.
    Those who desire to conserve their roots choose old names from their history and legends to give their children.

    \paragraph{Common Names}
    (Male) Anton, Aseir, Diero, Dorn, Evendur, Grim, Haseid, Ivor, Khemed, Kosef, Marcon, Morn, Pavel, Pieron, Rimardo, Romero, Salazar, Sergor, Umbero, Zasheir;

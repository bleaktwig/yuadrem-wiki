# Humes
Et created humes to aid the oric god in the War of Spring.
Despite this, many opposed the conflict, or felt indifferent to it.
They fled the company of their god-tree, for which they were cursed with feathers.
They came to be known as irds, and this dispersion came to be known as the Ird Diaspora.
<!-- NOTE. This led to the first siege of Ctereth, where four different ird chiefdoms (led by 4 historic figures) stole qualars to allow their kin to travel away from Naptane. -->
The humes that remained with Et were blessed with horns, and are known as gats.
<!-- NOTE. Maybe mention what ird and gat mean in jantherlin? That might help integrate the language into the lore. -->

---
## Physical Description
Humes are of a broad spectrum.
Before the penance, humes traveled the entirety of Yuadrem, and they are as varied as the environments they settled.
Their height usually varies from slightly more than a meter to about 2.
They can weigh anything from 40 to 120 kg.
Their skin shades to any color from the darkest brown to the lightest hues.
They can grow long hair from their scalps and faces, with a great variety of color and thickness.

While this varies from culture to culture, in general a hume is considered an adult between 14 and 16 years.
Due to high child mortality, life expectancy averages to 25 years.
For those who reach that age, they have a reasonable chance of reaching 50 to 60 years.
Sorcerers are well known for extending their lives, and it is not unusual for them to live even more than a century. <!-- NOTE. The downside of this are all the negative effects of Pheter use in the body, Nix sickness, deformed bodies + strange appendages, etc. -->

Humes are a gendered kin, and usually have one child at a time.
Previous to the Schism, childcare was left to the women of the families, in particular to each child's mother.
This varies among cultures, and communal childcare is the norm after the Penance.

---
## Gat Culture
<!-- NOTE. Those who sided with Et. Et-born families still retain horns (by feeding the mother Et's sap), which were first gifted by Et to their loyal soldiers. -->
After the Schism, the surviving gats separated into three groups: noves, bughna, and treb.
Those who remained became known as noves gats, and their ethnicity is the most common in the modern world.
They built the holy city of Naptane inside the stump of Et, from which sprung the Seven Principates of the Sea.
Noves are often considered simile to civilization.

Bughna gats endured the 40-Year Famine by adopting a nomadic lifestyle, one which defines them still.
These humes became known as great pastors and merchants.
They strenghtened the bond between the principates, in part allowing the establishment of the large gat civilization.
Even today they are often associated to good luck.

Not all progeny of Et was born equal, and the treb are the perfect example.
They are larger and bulkier than the average hume, and were often the first line of attack in the War of Spring.
Treb gats were regarded as brutish, and didn't fit the civilization built by the noves.
They were exiled by Olag during the second century, and most established a new home in the Dead Sea.
<!-- NOTE. Treb gats are not *born* brutish. While their culture may seem "violent", they are very religious and show a sophistication with nature that is not commonly seen in other humes. -->

### Physical Description.
The skin of a gat is generally dark, usually ranging from yellow, through brown, to black.
While some gats are blonde, the most common hair colors and brown, black, and sometimes red.
It is a common gat custom to sport long hair and beards, often decorated with jewelry.

With the exception of the treb, gats are generally small, ranging from 140 to 170 centimeters on average.
Another common feature accross gats is their eyes; which are usually of strong colors.

While all original gats had horns, the feature has been lost through the centuries.
Those birthed by the remains of the god-tree, or Et-born, retain the horns.
Yet they are increasingly rare after the Penance, as nix has destroyed the land that surrounds the tree.

<!-- NOTE. Tale of the gestation of an et-born.
    Gats are genderless creatures.
    All gats are born with a pair of seeds hidden in a small sack between their legs.
    Around the age of 30, a gat reaches physical maturity.
    This is signalled by a slight swelling in these seeds, which they can now cut and plant under a thick layer of rich soil.

    While underground, the seed will grow by leeching nutrients off the earth.
    After a gestation period of around 2 years, the gat will dig their way up from the ground and emerge as a somewhat competent infant.
    A gat would-be-parent must always be careful about where to plant their seed, for if a newborn sees the sun or any strong light during their first days, they run the risk of being permanently blinded.

\section{Horned Kin} \label{kin::gat}
\DndDropCapLine{W}{hen you contract a horned one, be}
\textit{sure to pay them double.
Fulfill all their needs as they seclude into their workshop, and pay no mind to their uncanny silence.
Most of all, be sure to avoid interrupting them.
Just wait.
The prize that will arrive after they're done working is sure to outshine all your other possessions, and hold a special place in your collection for you and your descendants.}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Orr, Vesjen's master smith.

\subsection*{Adaptable and Hardy}
    Gat share many traits with the common goat.
    They dwell on bleak mountaintops, deep ravines, rocky hills, and open plains.
    While adult gats are not sensitive to sunlight, most prefer dark places.
    These predilections lead to gat towns and cities being built underground or in harsh cliff faces.

    Never satisfied with their homes, the horned kin's hubris leads to their cities to reach depth and size.
    Raids against smaller gat city-state are common, and the gats take them as a chance to test their impenetrable defenses, complex traps, and combat-hardened military skills.

\subsection*{Peaceful Demeanor}
    The horned kin are peaceful creatures and mostly shun external conflict.
    They are very sociable creatures, and all city-states have one large marketplace in their center for merchants and caravans to settle in.
    Surrounded by inns and taverns, these markets act as the commerce hubs of the city.

    Community lifestyle is very important to gats, and most wouldn't flinch to give their lives for their city-state.
    Due to the gats' slow reproductive cycle, their cities are very welcoming to other species.
    It's common to find cities and towns where less than half of the total population is gat.
    They treat other species as kin, but high political and military ranks are exclusive to gats.

\subsection*{Impulse towards Greatness}
    It is rare for a gat to willingly leave their home, and most spend their entire lives in one city-state.
    However, some do feel the call to adventure, and most follow it to gather rare crafting materials or to fulfill a task needed by their community.

    Gats are meticulous individuals, and this naturally extends to adventurers.
    They won't step into the wilderness unprepared, sparing no expense in armor, weapons, utilities, and the training to use all of this.

    Gats are naturally family-oriented, and its very rare for one gat to abandon their progeny.
    In the rare occasion that a gat does decide to leave their community behind, it is written law to leave one child or seed planted back home.

    This tradition serves a double purpose.
    First, the child acts as a magnet to their parent.
    Second, in the event that the child is orphaned, their mere presence at least maintains a steady population number.
    These gats are the ``Children of the Collective'', and it is tradition that they are taken care of by the whole city, thus nurturing a strong sense of community.

\subsection*{Gat Names}
    All gat tongues are simple and practical languages, and the horned ones have a tendency towards easy to pronounce names.
    A parent gives their child their name once they gain independence, and its rare for a gat to change it.
    Gats don't use family names, preferring instead to wear their main profession as a surname.

\section{Winged Kin} \label{kin::ird}
\DndDropCapLine{Y}{es, sure, you can create a machine to}
\textit{glide.
You can even ride a creature to stay aloft.
But you will never truly fly.
No kin can tame the sky with such grace as the irds.
Trust me, if they weren't so humble as to live among us, constrained to the ground, we'd be building temples to venerate their graciousness.}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Josiah, priest from the church of Rhekesh.

Sequestered in high mountains, deep jungles, and hot deserts, the irds, sisz rlue, or winged kin are known to survive some of the harshest environments all around Yuadrem.

\subsection*{Beak and Feather}
    From below, irds look much like large birds.
    Only when they descend to roost or walk in the ground does their humanoid appearance reveal itself.
    Standing upright, an ird might reach 2 meters tall.
    They have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons.

    Feathers cover their bodies, with their plumage typically reflecting the environment they develop in.
    Their heads complete the avian appearance, being that of a parrot, hawk, or vulture.
    Irds' arms have very long feathers, which allow them to fly with ease.
    The three subraces of the irds are very distinct from each other.
    This is due to the fact that they were created by three different ets, all in pursuit of a same goal, yet for different environments.

    The winged kin are the only gendered species created by the tall kin.
    Some time after reproduction, a female will lay one to three eggs and the couple will refrain from contact with others in their tribe, becoming extremely protective of their children until they reach maturity.

\subsection*{Sky Wardens}
    Nowhere are the irds more comfortable than in the sky.
    They can spend hours in the air, and some go as long as days, locking their wings in place and letting the thermals hold them aloft.
    In battle, they prove dynamic and acrobatic fliers, moving with remarkable speed and grace, diving to lash opponents with weapons or talons before turning and flying away.

    Once airborne, an ird leaves the sky with reluctance.
    They sometimes forget or ignore vertical distances, and they have nothing but pity for those earthbound kins forced to live and toil constrained to the ground.

    The ird are a tribal species, and its rare for a tribe to hold more than a hundred irds at once.
    The only exceptions to this rule are the Krudzal and Kaldrathal, both large countries in the northern reaches of Yuadrem.
    They are welcoming to traders and visitors in general, but generally don't allow members from other kins to be permanent residents within their territory, and frown upon guests who overstay their welcome.

    Once tribes of irds settle in an area, they share a hunting territory that extends across an area up to 150 km on a side, with each tribe hunting in the lands nearest to their colony, ranging farther should game become scarce.
    A typical colony consists of one large, open-roofed nest made of woven vines.
    The eldest acts as leader with the support of a shaman.

\subsection*{Avian Mannerisms}
    The resemblance of ird to birds isn't limited to physical features.
    Irds display many of the same mannerisms as ordinary birds.
    They are fastidious about their plumage, frequently tending their feathers, cleaning and scratching away any tiny passengers they might have picked up.
    When they deign to descend from the sky, they often do so near pools where they can catch fish and bathe themselves.
    Even when perched on a high branch or at rest in their mountaintop homes, they appear alert, with eyes moving and bodies ready to take flight.

    Many winged kin punctuate their speech with chirps, sounds they use to convey emphasis and to shade meaning.
    An ird might become frustrated with people who fail to pick up on the nuances; an ird's threat might be taken as a jest and vice versa.
    Confinement terrifies the winged kin.
    To be imprisoned by the cold, unyielding earth is a torment few ird can withstand.

\subsection*{Innate Curiosity}
    Irds are naturally curious which, summed with their freedom of movement, leads to them being the ideal explorers and adventurers.
    They use their large wings to travel to almost any place in the entirety of Yuadrem, and as such they've become a common sight in all its reaches.
    Outside of their tribes, irds do enjoy living within other civilizations, and its rare to see a city or large settlement without at least one ird inhabitant.

    % Winged kin tribes are accepting of their members leaving for indefinite amounts of time, and this is even encouraged in many communities.
    % In fact, the population of a tribe is ever-changing, with the only constants being the eldest members and the shaman.
    % This means that neighboring tribes have strong and healthy relations, each coming to aid the ones in need without question.
    % Another consequence of their tendency to travel is the versatility of ird artisans, who integrate techniques from all around Yuadrem into their craft.

\subsection*{Ird Names}
    Ird names separate into two main categories.
    The first resemble their original language, Harualish, and include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other kins have a difficult time pronouncing them.
    When interacting with other races, they may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.

    On the other hands, irds from Krudzal, Kaldrathal, and other civilized lands tend to speak Shanise.
    Shanise is a language formed from the interaction of Harualish-speaking irds and Avshenese-speaking gats in the north.

    An ird last name is usually simply ``son/daughter of'' followed by one of their parent's name.
    Most irds admire their parents, and wear their last names with pride.

    \paragraph{Harualish Ird Names}
    Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, Zeed.

    \paragraph{Male Shanise Ird Names}
    Aden, Azat, Daneal, Dirkir, Eastean, Goker, Idrahin, Jakod, Jaldor, Jasin, Kuneit, Lutdzu, Nuretin, Nutlar, Rezat, Semir, Shasar, Tajik, Tenel, Tshasin, Unut.

    \paragraph{Female Shanise Ird Names}
    Aise, Asutshan, De\~na, Dilsad, Dorun, Drinja, Eda, Gudlag, Gulden, Hazal, Iris, Katrin, Kisnet, Naina, Nerhe, Sehil, Selna, Sher, Solveag, Tedziye, Zainej.

    You have disadvantage on this check if you have a roof above you.
    On a failure, you fall to the ground at a rate of 100 meters per round, taking falling damage when hitting the ground.
    If you haven't landed at the beginning of your next turn, you can continue flying normally, albeit 100 meters below where you were before.

    \subparagraph{Graceful Landing} Your years of living at great heights have taught you how to fall more gracefully.

\subsubsection{Qulbaba Ird}
    Many irds can be found living in isolated tribes inside the jungles of Yuadrem.
    In the east they live in Harual, and in the west in the Jenkashian empire.
    Qulbaba ird have a face resembling that of a parrot, and their feathers' coloration depends on their gender.
    Males usually have very brightly colored feathers, showing any combination of colors.
    Females mostly have dull gray, brown, and dark green feathers, aiding their ability to hide in the jungle.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{04kins/img/12ird_qulbaba.png}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{thulkraka Ird}
    Unlike their brethren, the thulkraka tribes that settled on the many mountaintops of Yuadrem live their lives mostly constrained to the ground, and are only able to fly when the harsh mountain weather allows it.
    They are thus bulkier than the average ird, and commonly are clumsy fliers due to their lack of experience.
    Their faces are similar to that of hawks, and their feathers' coloration is bleak and cold, usually sporting white, gray, light blue, and brown colors.

    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Isolated from other races, you have been able to take the time to truly appreciate the calmness of the mountains.
    Your Wisdom score is increased by 1.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Dratl Ird}
    Irds from the Dratl houses are known as ruthless ruffians, and are pariahs to the other winged kin subspecies.
    They are known for constantly harassing the other ird tribes, as well as any who approach their territory.
    The are collectively banned from entering any tribe from the other subspecies, and are usually unwelcome in towns and cities due to their bad reputation.

    Nowadays, Dratl houses are scattered around the Zoedrem desert, mostly unorganized.
    These are the remnants of the once great empire of Hulnar, disbanded in 591 AS.
    Despite their lost grandness, they are still feared by the common people, and continue to fiercely protect their hunting grounds.

    A Dratl ird's beak resembles that of a vulture, and their feathers are generally black, white, and red.
    As a dratl ird grows up, their irises become noticeably white, while the sclera surrounding them turn into a bright red color.

    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Your time surviving in the harsh climate of the desert has given you an increased robustness.
    Your Constitution score is increased by 1.

    \subparagraph{Wing Flap} When you use the disengage action, you can choose to use another action to propel yourself upward a distance equal to half your flying speed.

    \subparagraph{Bone Breaker} While flying, you can attempt to attack a creature with an eviscerating attack.
    Using two actions, you can swoop down up to your flying speed towards a creature you can see, and make a melee weapon attack roll against it.
    If the attack hits, it's a critical hit.
    The attack is tiring, and you can use this trait only once per combat encounter.
    % You can use this trait once per combat encounter.

Brought into this world with the Schism, the nomad kin are a strange race from Nyx.
Also known as umans, they have almost hairless bodies, and are similar in appearance to apes.

For an unknown reason, umans attract all kinds of predators from these lands.
Additionally, their blood has similar properties to the tall ones', and is used in many rituals.
Because of these reasons, umans are dispersed all around the world, and are nomadic in nature.

\subsection*{Accursed Coldblood} TODO. Maybe include the concept of coldblood in the "new" Yuadrem. Perhaps the blood of a certain breed of humes is actually better than average at keeping pheter - even better than oil. Actually, in general blood being better than oil at keeping Pheter is an interesting concept by itself!
    Known as coldblood due to its cerulean tint, Umans' blood has special properties, and is very useful for spellcasters.
    It retains a sort of energy, and can be used as a source of spells.
    Umans know this, and regularly prepare blood vials for trade and to strengthen troupes' wizards.

    Umans pay dearly for this special blood, as it acts as a beacon for the predators from Nyx, the Nyxborn.
    These creatures hunt umans, and many of the kin are banned from villages for safety concerns.

    Spellcasters seek coldblood, and many try to attain it by any means available.
    Naturally, the murder of umans for their blood is illegal in most nations, but some carry the custom on nevertheless.
    The nimrods are a cult that specializes in gathering coldblood via any means available, and are commonly contracted by wizards and warlocks to attain the product.

\subsection*{Adaptable and Durable}
    Hunted by both beast and kin, umans have trouble trusting others and don't normally settle in communities of other kins.
    They live in troupes exclusive to their kin, where usually all members have some familiar relationship.
    Troupes travel together and care for each other, assigning specific roles to each member based on their skills.

    Far from vulnerable, most troupes are fierce and resilient, hardened by centuries of being preyed upon.
    Groups keep track of how they are treated by different cities and towns, and only do commerce where they are accepted.

    While uncommon, some uman communities have managed to settle in one place.
    These communities keep their locations secret, communicating it only to other umans via traveler's cant, a set of writings and symbols they brought from Nyx.

\subsection*{Life in Escapade}
    For a uman, a life of adventure is not a romantic desire but rather a fact of mundane life.
    Used to the hardships of survival, a uman is especially capable of fending off threats and surpassing hardships.

    It is very common to see lone uman adventurers, either as exiles or in a quest for their troupe.
    Whatever the motive, they naturally excel at voyages, and are a great fit on any adventuring party.

\subsection*{Uman Names}
    Umans most commonly wear names from other cultures.
    Even in Nyx, umans were known to have a great variety of names depending on each specific culture.
    Those who desire to conserve their roots choose old names from their history and legends to give their children.

    Large, black horns grow on their heads, their skin and eyes turn into a very pale shade, and their bodies grow.

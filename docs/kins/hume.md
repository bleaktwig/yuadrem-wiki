# Humes
The god-tree [Et](../religion/godtrees/et.md) created humes to aid it's fight against [Om](../religion/godtrees/om.md) during the [War of Autumn](../history.md#war-of-autumn). Over time, many humes grew opposed to this conflict, and fled the company of their god-tree, for which they were cursed with monochromacy. These people came to be known as the _ird_, which roughly translates to "one who runs" in [jantherlin](../languages/index.md#etian-branch), and their dispersion around the world as the [Ird Diaspora](../history.md#war-of-autumn). Those that remained were blessed with Color, and are known as the _gat_, meaning "one who stays" in the old language.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Physical Description
Humes are of a broad spectrum. Before the [Penance](../history.md#age-of-sap), they traveled the entirety of Yuadrem, and are as varied as the environments they settled. Their height frequently ranges from slightly more than a meter to about 2, and can weigh anything from 40 to 120 kg, on average. Hume skin shades to any color from the darkest brown to the lightest hues. They can grow long hair from their scalps and faces, with great variety of color and thickness.

While this varies from culture to culture, in general a hume is considered an adult between 14 and 16 years, with life expectancy averaging at 25 years due to high child mortality. For humes who reach 25, they have a reasonable chance of living up to 50 or 60 years. Hume sorcerers<!--TODO.Link.---> are well known for extending their lifespan, and is usual for them to live even more than a century.
<!-- NOTE. The downside of this are all the negative effects of pheter use in the body, Nix sickness, deformed bodies + strange appendages, etc. --->

Most humes are a gendered kin, and mostly have one child at a time. The burden of caring for children varies across cultures: for gats, communal childcare is the norm, where everyone in the community or "bulu"<!--TODO:LINK.---> will care for those who can't care for themselves, while in most ird cultures it is often left to those considered "weak" by their communities.
<!-- NOTE. This is an oversimplification of relationships in ird cultures, ignoring that the separation into "weak" and "strong" doesn't really relate to physical strength. --->

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Gat Culture
### Distinctive Characteristics
The typical gat skin is dark, ranging from yellow, through brown, to black. While some gats are blonde, the most common hair colors are brown, black, with some shades of red. It is a common gat custom to sport long hair and beards, both often decorated with jewelry.

Gats are somewhat short people, ranging from 140 to 170 centimeters on average. A common feature among gats is their vibrant eyes: thanks to the Blessing of Color, they are of very strong colors, and most of them can change this color at will.

### Origins and History
The first gats were borne as the fruits of Et, and were marked with horns to signify their divine ascendance. Known as the Et-born, they are usually the most vigorous among gats, and are impervious to aging and to wounds that would be deadly to most. They are extremely rare in the current day, and the few that remain were born before the [Schism](../history.md#war-of-autumn).

While most Et-born are sterile, a peculiar one was different. The illuminant [Rerisi](../religion/index.md#illuminants) could produce offspring, and she did so in abundance—she created the _treb_, or "one who dies" in jantherlin. The treb are larger and bulkier than the average gat, and were often the first line of attack during the War of Autumn. Even as children of an Et-born, the treb were regarded as brutish, such that they didn't fit the civilization built by the other gats. In the third century, they were exiled by the [god-suzerain Olag](../religion/illuminants/olag.md), and most established a new home in the Dead Sea<!--TODO.Link.---> and in the Sylvan Canyon<!--TODO.Link.--->

<!-- NOTE. Rumors or facts?
    Treb gats are not *born* brutish. While their culture may seem "violent", they are deeply religious and show a sophistication with nature that is not commonly seen in other humes.
--->

<!-- NOTE. Tale of the gestation of a treb gat.
    The treb are genderless creatures. All treb are born with a pair of seeds hidden in a small sack between their legs. Around the age of 30, a treb reaches physical maturity. This is signaled by a slight swelling in these seeds, which they can now cut and plant under a thick layer of rich soil.

    While underground, the seed will grow by leeching nutrients off the earth. After a gestation period of around 2 years, the treb will dig their way up from the ground and emerge as a somewhat competent infant. A treb would-be-parent must always be careful about where to plant their seed, for if a newborn sees the sun or any strong light during their first days, they run the risk of being permanently blinded.
--->

After the Schism, the gats that remained around the charred corpse of Et became known as the noves, or the "one who stays" in jantherlin. The noves are the most common ethnicity in the modern world, and are often considered simile to civilization. They built the holy city of Naptane<!-- TODO. Link. --> inside the stump of Et, from which sprung the [Seven Princedoms of the Sea](../history.md#age-of-winter).

The bughna, or "one who leaves", endured the [40-Year Famine](../history.md#age-of-winter) by adopting a nomadic lifestyle, one which defines them still. These humes became known as great pastors and merchants, and strengthened the bonds between the princedoms, helping in the establishment of the large gat civilization. Even today they are often associated to good luck.

### Clothing
Clothes are varied across the different gat cultures, but one thing remains constant: a person's garments generally focuses on a few particular, strong colors. Blessed by Color, gats are particularly affected by the hue of their clothing, and they take advantage of this to manipulate their mind, personality, and physiology.

While working, a laborer might wear red with hints of magenta to allow their body to enhance their physical strength. A scholar may wear blue with details in cyan and chartreuse to improve their memory retention. Travelers often wear green in the day to speed up their travels, then orange or saffron during the night to receive more warmth from their bonfire.

### Traditions and Religion
**Families and guilds.**
To the noves, a family is defined as the group of people with whom one shares housing. Most members of a family share a profession, and large families are known as guilds. The head of a family is usually either its oldest member or someone designated by vote.

In most gat cultures, a child becomes a member of their mother's family when they're born, and their care becomes a communal endeavor. When they reach adulthood—usually around year 14—a gat can choose to join another family, as long as they're accepted by this family's head. The departure is often accompanied by a ceremonial feast shared by the two families.
<!-- NOTEs.
    * Many members of a child's family have an important role in their development, and a special place in their heart :).
    * Noves culture has its members remain at home a lot. Either lean into this or figure out more collective celebrations.
--->

**Death.**
Across gat cultures, the dead are said to protect their families after their death, and old tradition dictates to bury the dead below the family house, usually under doors and windows. Lying below their loved ones strengthens the dead as they take on the role of a protector.
<!-- NOTE. The pheter in the bones of the dead literally aids the family by keeping nix out, but this effect is minor. --->

After the Penance, a new tradition that's quickly become commonplace is to burn some of the dead at the center of towns and villages. This helps to stave off [nix](../religion/primordials/nix.md), as the charred bones release their [pheter](../religion/primordials/pheter.md). While in general the specific manner a body is disposed of is chosen by the family, burning bodies is often mandatory when nix is on high tide.
<!-- NOTEs.
    * On the death of royalty. Kings and the royal family are burned after death. After that, their bones are placed on a giant mausoleum, all mixed together to accumulate their pheter.
    * Maybe I should play more with nix tides. Relate them to the moons, integrate the tri-lunar calendar into the "common" calendar to add some capacity to predict nix tides.
--->

**Religion.**
[Tanethism](../religion/index.md) is the standard faith in Yuadrem, and has been so since the early third century, albeit in a less organized manner than today's. While some dedicate their life to a particular god, it has no clergy or authorities—Tanethism is a fully personal religion. Altars to certain gods are common both in cities and in the wild, as small statues and temples are scattered all across Yuadrem.

Apart from providing the list and description of the religion's gods, the Book of Taneth details the myriad of rituals to each of them. Most gats have a predilection toward certain gods, and include small rituals to them into daily life, as liturgy is attached to any activity one deems important. Perhaps due to their unique connection to the divine, the treb are particularly religious, and the number and complexity of their rituals exceeding those of the other kins.

**Bughna moon rituals.**
The bughna have a special admiration towards [Kegal, the indigo moon](../religion/mevic_gods/fusine.md), and the nomadic patterns of animal herders are aligned to this moon's phases. The search for new grazing grounds only occurs while the fundamental signature of lightning is in phase, as the gats feel protected by the signature's gaze. They also celebrate thunderstorms as portents of the god, sometimes engaging in dangerous rituals seeking her favor.

**Aversion to piercing.**
One thing in common for all gats is their aversion to penetration wounds, especially so after the Penance. Punctures are believed to cause a leakage of the pheter trapped inside the body, such that not only the victim's body is damaged, but their soul is as well.
<!-- NOTEs.
    * The soul is the pheter stored in a body.
    * Olag punished traitors by impaling them in pikes, but without crossing major organs (idk how tho?). Then, not only did they bleed slowly, but they could feel their soul leaking away.
--->

### Names
By old tradition, gats have various names, which don't have a particular order and may change during a person's lifetime. In addition, different people and communities will often know a person by different names. Names are not made official, and the duty of recording individuals is left to each family.

While the intricacies of these names are unique to each community—and sometimes a particular family—five categories are common:

* A **personal name** is the name given to a gat my their mother, usually soon after birth. People usually keep this personal name thorough life, but nothing stops them from changing it.
* A **parent name** is the name of a gat's parent followed by the suffix _ban/van_, which means "sibling of" in [avshenese](../languages/index.md#avshenesian-family). Additional parent names can be added after the first one, climbing up a branch of the family tree. A person may prefer to use one or more of these names if they have a particularly known ancestor.
* A **profession name** is simply the name of the profession practiced by the gat.
* A **family name** is gained by all members of a family or guild upon being born into or joining it. Sometimes, the head of the family will add the _grit_ suffix to this family name, which translates to "head" in avshenese.
* A **locality name** which reflects the origin of the gat. The _she_ prefix is added to it, which is a phoneme associated to location in avshenese. These names are usually only used by travelers, and depend on the extensions of these travels—a gat coming from a different town may be referred to by the name of that town, while one from another kingdom or sumi<!--TODO:LINK.---> will acquire its name.

Personal names are often easy to pronounce. A non-exhaustive list of common ones is:
Adrevik, Agik, Ak, Ani, Anux, Aren, Avag, Baen, Bevan, Dzurar, Gauren, Gevaug, Grigur, Guxar, Kadzak, Kevun, Marim, Narek, Pagran, Puguse, Rauben, Sivadre, Sona, Xarig, Xuvep.

<!-- NOTE. On names.
    * Oths hate the many names convention - organizing family trees and keeping track of historic figures is a total pain.
    * "Personal name" "parent name" "profession name" "family name" "locality name" "greatest achievement name (sometimes)".
    * Names are neither official nor recorded, but presenting yourself with a name that contains a lie is very badly seen, and may even be punished in some ethnic groups.
    * Just knowing someone's full name gives you a lot of information on that person.

## Ird Culture
### Distinctive Characteristics
Irds are usually easy to recognize due to their size, which on average is about 175 centimeters. Their skin color varies greatly, but they are generally somewhat paler than gats. Their eye color is also assorted, also often less saturated than that of a gat.

Kulbaba and dral are rather slender, while the thulk are generally tall and broad. Hair color is also a feature commonly used to determine the ethnicity of an ird. Thulk irds often have either blonde, black, or ginger hair. Then, the kulbaba have brown hair, usually in dark shades. Dral irds have light brown or crimson hair, which tends to gray at an earlier age than other humes.

### Origins and History
The first humes to renounce the War of Autumn and abandon Et were the irds. Persecuted by the god-tree fanatics, they fled far from the Horned Shores<!--TODO:LINK--->, and far away from the grasp of Et. This event is known as the [Ird Diaspora](../history.md#war-of-apring). While many different ethnicities came from this event, the main ones that remain after the Penance are three. In order of their number, the thulk, the kulbaba, and the dral.

<!-- TODO list:
    * Maybe talk a bit more here about the 4 "faces" of the ird diaspora; thulk, hairus, kulbaba, and dral.
-->

The thulk migrated to the northernmost regions of Yuadrem, establishing the old nation of Krudzal around the north pole. Here, they were the first to develop ironworking, with which they built imposing sailing ships with iron hulls. Krudzalites used these vessels to claim many territories in the continent, later forming many independent states such as Gronselar<!-- TODO. Link. --> and Kaldrathal, among others.

The kulbaba were the second to emigrate, and settled on the tropical islands of the Qul Archipelago<!--TODO:LINK--->. Here they separated into a myriad of chiefdoms, claiming the islands and many nearby territories. While they never achieved complete cooperation between chiefs, they became known as the Jenkash Empire<!-- TODO. Link. --> at their maximum expansion.

<!-- TODO. Update this. -->
Inside the Fesh Peninsula, thulk from Gronselar conquered the easternmost peninsula, establishing their nation in territories claimed from Ushpavam<!-- TODO. Link. -->. Some kulbaba from the Dentralin Chiefdom<!-- TODO. Link. --> also  settled the region, becoming part of the Sumi of Fremit<!-- TODO. Link. --> and establishing temples in the Saefel Canyon<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

The dral were the last to leave the grasp of Et. They migrated to the desert of Zoedrem, also separating into chiefdoms. Not many of them remain, but some did enter the Fesh Peninsula traveling together with the bughna.

### Clothing
Irds were said to have been cursed with feathers when they fled the War of Autumn. While today they don't grow feathers, a common feature in ird attire is the usage of plumage in their clothing. Before the Penance, the color of their clothes depended on their ethnicity. Now, colorful feathers are usually only used in traditional rituals, as most fear the effect the colors may have on their bodies.

Thulk, who settled in cold climates, used to wear vermilion fabrics with complex patterns above many layers of fur. Nowadays, while their attires are lighter, they keep this color despite the change in environment. Dral, used to the desert of Zoedrem<!--TODO:LINK--->, wore simple cyan and mint clothing to cool them and give them speed. The kulbaba in contrast often kept the colorful patterns from their old traditions, recently adapted to fibers rather than feathers.

### Traditions and Religion
**Competitions.**
Competitions are commonplace to irds, and are the preferred way to settle disagreements. They are usually as public as possible, and are often encouraged and celebrated by others. These matches can involve anything the participants deem necessary. If they are expected to lead to physical injury or death, the chief is to be informed beforehand, and they must either bear witness or anoint someone to do so. Dral competitions are particularly ferocious, and they often involve combat or violence.

**Promise of Allegiance.**
As long as both people are willing, anyone can make a public promise of allegiance to another. The person making the vow is called the First, while the other is the Second. In this commitment, the First promises to fight and obey any command of the Second. In exchange, the Second must always be fair to the First, and provide home, food, and water to them.

It is common for the whole chiefdom or a large part of it to make a promise of allegiance to the chief. The vow lasts until the death of any of either person. If a First or Second fails to fulfill their part, they may be judged and exiled, depending on the local ruler and the choice of the other.

**Children and Marriage.**
Before marriage, irds are encouraged to meet and form bonds with others, usually many at a time. When a woman becomes pregnant, she decides who among her suitors is to be the father. In southern thulk culture, however, she can decide on many suitors at once. They then must complete a set of challenges of the bride's choosing. The winner becomes the groom, while the others are to act as servants during the wedding.

The marriage celebration is generally large, and the whole chiefdom or village is expected to take part in it. As their vows, both members are expected to make a promise of allegiance to the other, such as the one they have with their chiefs.

**Adulthood.**
To become an adult, a child must participate in a competition held in a Day of Change. The particular Days of Change vary across cultures, but all are aligned with the tri-lunar tidal phases, as seen in the Nuagalian Calendar<!-- TODO. Link. -->. Victors in these matches then become adults, while other contestants must wait for subsequent Days of Change. Adulthood is a requirement to make a promise of allegiance, and as such one cannot marry before becoming an adult.

**Death and Funerals.**
Irds believe that a person's soul remains in the body after they die. No funeral is celebrated upon death, and bodies are blindfolded and laid to rest inside a communal crypt. Thulk keep oil urns with the bodies, burning the crypt on the Day of the Immortal, a leap day that occurs every 10 years. Dral kept their crypts open, allowing vultures to eat the remains and the desert sun to dry the rest. Kulbaba crypts were often dug below the crown of a banyan tree, allowing [elves](elf.md) to rise from the bodies of the dead irds.

### Names
While the most common language spoken by irds is [shanise](../languages/index.md#avshenesian-family), a language in the [avshenesian family](../index.md#avshenesian-family), ird naming conventions are related to the [harualian family](../languages/index.md#harualian-family). By this custom, each ird has two names. Their first name is given to them at birth either by their parents or by the village's chief. Then, their second name is inherited from a parent of their choice, adding the prefix *u/ud*, which means "son/daughter of". It is common in ird culture to admire one's parents, and these names are carried with pride.

Ird names are often hard to pronounce by native frisian speakers, and as such irds commonly gain nicknames in Fesh. Common male names in ird culture include:
Aden, Azat, Daneal, Dirkir, Eastean, Goker, Idrahin, Jakod, Jaldor, Jasin, Kuneit, Ludzu, Nuretin, Nutlar, Rezat, Semir, Shasar, Tajik, Tenel, Shasin, Unut.

Then, a few common female names are:
Aise, Anutshan, Dena, Dilsad, Dorun, Drinja, Eda, Gudlag, Gulden, Hazal, Iris, Katrin, Kisnet, Naina, Nere, Sehil, Selna, Sher, Solveag, Tedzije, Zainesh.

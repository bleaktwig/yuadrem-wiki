# Imates
[Om](../religions/tanethism_pantheon.md#om) created imates to defend the oric god from [Et](../religions/tanethism_pantheon.md#et) and the [humes](hume.md) in the War of Spring<!-- TODO. Link. -->. While not particularly suited for war, the kin defended their god-tree until the Schism<!-- TODO. Link. -->. For this, they were Blessed with Word. After the burning of Om, imates escaped genocide by migrating to the south, spreading thorough the southern reaches of Yuadrem.

## Physical Description
Imates share some resemblance with humes. Both kins poise the bulk of their weight on two legs, have the same number of digits, and are able to express their emotions through facial expression. However, the body of an imate is covered in hair, which ranges in color from white, through many shades of brown, to black. Lacking the gats' Blessing of Color, no hints of Red or Yellow is seen in their hair. Then, a common trait to all imates are their very large ears, which are surrounded by a tuft of white hair.

Imates are separated into two very different species: the oras and the arsets. Oras have larger bodies. An average adult stands at around 2 meters upright, but they would struggle to maintain this posture for long. Hunched, they're not usually taller than a meter and a half. They have strong bodies and long arms, and often weight more than 100 kg.

Arsets are small in comparison, usually not reaching more than 90 cm in length and 15 kg in weight. While they are not as strong as the oras, they have longer claws and a long, striped tail, both of which they use to climb with great dexterity.

Imates are considered adults at around 10 years, and tend to live to be around 70 and 80 years. As they age, their hair changes color to display particular signatures, thanks to the Blessing of Word. This, in addition to maintaining the strength of elder imates, extends their natural age in a manner similar to hume sorcerers.

## Clothing and accessories
Due to their fur and proclivity to warm and humid weathers, imates in general do not cover their bodies in clothing. It is common to just wear a tabard<!-- TODO. I am not sure if "tabard" is the word I'm looking for here. Check it out more in detail. -->, but some include more fabrics with a purely aesthetic purpose. Imate shamans are the exception: as tattooing their body would not be too effective, they wear long ribbons of white fabric with apomantic signatures, forming circuits<!-- TODO. I need a better word than "circuit". --> around their bodies. While they cannot switch between circuits as fast as tattooed hume sorcerers, this system allows them to change between signatures with ease.

For self expression, imates wear an abundance of accessories, often made of copper or gold. Common examples include bands in the arms and legs, rings, and braid rings. Piercings in the face and ears are the sign of adulthood in the kin. These accessories are often made of bone, wood, copper, or gold, and imates puts more value in the complexity of the design than the material from which it was made.

## Origins and history
After the Schism, imates were left without the canopy of Om to protect them. As such, they settled south of the Turtle Sea, surviving the 40-Year Famine thanks to the abundant flora of the area. These settlements were short lived, however, as after recovering from the famine, gats took to hunting imates en masse<!-- TODO. Am I using this expression right? -->, sparking the Ededian Genocide.

The imates that survived continued migrating south, and settled in [...]<!-- TODO. Check map and add locations. -->. <!-- TODO. Talk about the diverging cultures as they moved around, focusing on the ones that actually went back to Fesh. -->

After the Penance, [...]<!-- TODO. Talk about the imates that invaded the Fesh Peninsula along with Gronselar. -->.

<!-- TODO. Talk about the other groups of imates that migrated to the area. -->

## Culture and traditions
**Village as family.**
Imates have fully communal families. An imate will usually not know who their particular parents are, and they regard the village in which they were born as their family. When a family grows too large, it will often split. In this process, the mother family will remain in the old village, while the daughter family embarks on a journey to settle.

An imate's family is for life. Adoption in general only occurs between mother and daughter families, and even in this context it is rare.

**Dual dwellings.**
Traditional imate villages consist of two room styles. The larger are wood and fiber circular huts, built on the trunks of trees. These are used for storage and to house adult oras<!--, who are too large to easily climb the canopies -- TODO. Are they tho? -->. Where the dirt allows, patches of farmland surround these huts, and are worked by the oras.

Then, the branches of the same trees are covered in interconnected chambers, built from weaving grass and plant fibers. Three types of these arboreal rooms exist: shared housing for adult arsets, nurseries for all imate younglings, and farming rooms. In these last ones, arsets leave a mixture of chewed leaves and bark, growing mushrooms from otherwise inedible foraged material.

In Fesh, it is common to see one or two of these arboreal communities inside towns and villages. While historical differences still rift the kins, the Penance has forced the formation of these mixed communities.

**Death and return to Om.**
It is a common belief that a dead imate's soul can only return to Om if its body rots under the earth. Imates traditionally bury their dead below their farmlands, and thus the huts of the oras serve to mourn the recently dead.

For this reason, imates are very reacious to the barkskin<!-- TODO. Link + namechange. --> cycle of birth, since it retards their process of reunification with their god. Furthermore, burning a dead body is extreme sacrilege. If an imate dies by burning or in any way that won't allow its body to rot, as the their soul will never find their way back to Om.

**Specialized roles.**
Due to their differences, oras and arsets tend to take different roles in their society. Arsets, being small and mobile, hunt, scout, and trade with neighboring villages. Oras, larger and stronger, defend the village, along with tending plantations, tending the young, and crafting items and accessories. Traditionally, one or more oras act as the village shamans, conducting rites and communing with the recently dead.
<!-- NOTE. The building of a village is a collective task. -->

**Tradition and Tanethism.**
Imate tradition follows the belief in the divinity of the tree-gods and their relation to the Ring of Color<!-- TODO. Link. -->. They associate the god-trees to the six world signatures<!-- TODO. I should explain this in the cosmology page... -->, and have unique signatures for each of the seven trees<!-- NOTE. Draw these signatures whenever I work on the imate apomantic system. -->. In general they don't place Om above the other god-trees, but they do praise their dead god more than the others.

While many have adapted to Tanethism, their traditional cosmology does not recognize the Mevic Gods<!-- TODO. Link. --> as the makers of the tree-gods. They do, however, recognize Pheter<!-- TODO. Link. --> and Nix<!-- TODO. Link. --> as the forces of creation, and recognize the connection that Illuminants<!-- TODO. Link. --> have with Pheter.

## Names
**TODO.** Improve upon babazano while maintaining the silliness.

\subsection*{Misleading Appearance}
    Marsets don't seem terribly intimidating at first glance.
    They however have an unusual defense mechanism for driving away threats, which includes any unfortunate creature that disturbs their large arboreal colonies.

    Each marset grows specialized quills from their back, with a smooth tip and a base with four flanges, like the fletching of an arrow.
    In additional to making the marsets quite painful to grab, these quills are used as projectiles.

    The little creatures construct their own bows, stripping bark from bendy twigs with their teeth to create the limbs, and harvesting spiderweb for the string.
    The strands are rubbed together with sand, which is done to thicken the bowstring and reduce stickiness in the middle, creating a sophisticated weapon to launch quills at unlucky foes.

    For shorter range, marsets also use hollow reeds to blow their quills as darts.
    It's common for the smarter marsets to apply manure or poison to their arrows and darts, improving their deadliness.

\subsection*{Repetitive Language}
    Marsets hatch from their eggs already able to speak a strange repetitive language, which is entirely regular and does not evolve.
    This language --- known as Babazano --- can be spoken in one of two ways: soundlessly, with the communication happening through lip reading, or screamed as loud as possible, with no middle ground.
    Despite this, a marset can learn other languages and not constantly scream at the top of their lungs, but they do tend to be loud speakers.

    Babazano has only ten consonants.
    All verbs use a single consonant as their root, so there's only ten verbs.
    By repeating syllables they create new meanings, which makes their language very difficult to understand by the other kins, but for these little creatures it's no issue at all.
    They hear or lip-read a word and instinctively know which one it is.

\subsection*{Marset Names}
    Marsets assign names to each other based on distinctive features and accomplishment.
    An individual marset will wear many names during their childhood, and when they settle on one is when they reach adulthood.
    Due to the peculiarity of Babazano, it is a common for the other kins to call them by simple monikers, practice that the marsets despise.
    % Most marsets don't particularly like this, and are very reluctant to accept a nickname given to them.

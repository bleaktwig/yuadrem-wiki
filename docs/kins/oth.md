# Oths
The god-tree [Tol](../religion/godtrees/tol.md) created oths in the early [Age of Spring](../history.md#age-of-spring), and the new kin adapted to life alongside [gats](hume.md#gat-culture). Due to their physical similarities, oths quickly gained the trust of their sibling kin, and most of them stayed in Naptane<!--TODO:LINK---> and its surroundings, aiding humes in their endeavors.

<!--NOTE: OTH ETHNICITIES:
    * Those who stayed in Naptane.
    * Those who established Ignelli.
    * Those who established Gronselar among irds.

<!--NOTE. Maybe we could rename them to fey? plural fae.-->

## Physical description
While superficially similar to [humes](hume.md), an oth's features also harbor some resemblance to insects. Typically they measure between 130 to just under 180 centimeters, but are generally light and frail when compared to a hume of their size. Their skin varies from pale white to charred black, their hair ranges from very light blondes to vibrant browns, and their irises are always of dark brown colors. All members of the kin share the vitiligo condition, causing peach-colored patches to appear on their skin as they age.

Additionally, they have two sets of arms, one above the other. The upper pair—placed equally as that of humes—is strong and long, while the lower pair is weak and is mostly used for gentle tasks.  Their feet have three fingers and their arms have four, one being an opposable thumb, and they have a small pair of fluffy antennae over their heads which enhances their perception.

Oths are born in small eggs, inside which they develop for 4 to 10 months. They come out in a larval stage, which comprises most of their lifetime, as they grow from children to adults in a span of about 5 years. This larval phase lasts anywhere from 5 to 75 years, and oths have no sexual characteristics during it.

After reaching adulthood, an oth can choose to create a cocoon around themselves, inside of which they will stay for a period of 8 to 10 months. They come out of this pupa with a pair of pale, heavy forewings that hang around their bodies like cloaks, which hide a shorter and delicate set of hindwings behind them. Despite their two pairs of wings, the kin can't fly, but only hover and sometimes glide using them. The oth also chooses to develop male or female sexual characteristics, and gains the ability to produce silk, an extremely valuable material.

This stage in the oth's life lasts anywhere from 2 to 4 years. Due to this limited time, they will often seek partners fast, after which they will retire to lay a batch of 10 to 20 eggs.

## Clothing and accessories
Integrated into their culture from an early age, oths usually dress similarly to gats. Lacking the Blessing of Color<!--TODO:LINK--->, they don't wear many strong colors, but it's not unusual for them to wear deep blue robes to aid their concentration or patterned orange clothing to help maintain warmth.

Many members of the kin travel with a large, ornate scroll on their backs, protected by intricately weaved fabrics and by an impermeable leather guard. These are a compendium of knowledge passed down through generations, which attests to their inherent passion for knowledge.

<!--NOTE. Innate or fostered wisdom?
    Oths are often associated with deep knowledge and old wisdom. While for many this is true, there's nothing to suggest that this is a natural characteristic of the kin—perhaps they've been associated to these attributes for so long that they adapted to this title.

## Origins and history
After their nascency, oths were quickly absorbed into gat civilization. The first oths integrated into the imperial core of [god-suzerain Olag](../religion/illuminants/olag.md), taking on the profession of royal scribes, calculators, logicians, and strategists. As their numbers grew, they kept on taking administrative and custodian occupations, gaining the reputation of being people of wisdom that they hold to this day.

Over the years, some oths chose to leave the company of gats, leaving in the [Ignelli and Abipolash migrations](../history.md#age-of-spring). The former founded the city-state of Ignelli around the roots of the [god-tree Uld](../religion/godtrees/uld.md), creating a society where they could freely pursue their passion for knowledge. While the city was lost to the [Penance](../history.md#age-of-sap), many arrived into the Fesh Peninsula<!--TODO:LINK---> during the [three grand migrations](../history.md#age-of-sap), and settled in the island of Mbeat<!--TODO:LINK--->. The latter were lost to the Penance, regretfully, but some are rumored to have arrived together with the Nixwalkers<!--TODO:LINK---> in 800 A.S..

A few decades after the Ignelli migration, there was a schism of the city's inhabitants. A few, decidedly against the Ignellist school of thought, migrated further south in the [Visilli migration](../history.md#age-of-spring), and later established the old kingdom of Gronselar<!--TODO:LINK---> with the [irds](hume.md#ird-culture) that arrived later to colonize. These have also returned to the Peninsula during the [War of Summer](../history.md#age-of-sap), and live alongside the irds in the new kingdom of Gronselar<!--TODO:LINK--->.

## Culture and traditions
**Enigmatic and uncanny.**
While oths are fairly common in the civilized world, they are far more reclusive than humes. Often silent, oths have a reputation for being cryptic and thoughtful, and they tend to follow their intuition on a whim, sometimes against common sense.

**Cycle of resurrection.**
After an oth's pupal stage they know that their natural death quickly approaches, and they face it peacefully. After reproducing, a couple will say their goodbyes to then pilgrimage towards a cavern or secret place they designated during their lifetime. On arrival, the pair blocks all but one entrance to this sacred place, where the female lays eggs in a bed of silk. They then spend their time gathering food and lining the walls, floor, and roof with silk, providing a safe environment for their descendants to develop in.

Scholars also uses this time to make copies of their scrolls of knowledge, such that each of their newborn can receive one of their own. During the last week of summer, right before the eggs hatch, the oths will close the last entrance to this sacred place, engulfing it in darkness. Then they wait.

After the eggs hatch, the parents will nourish their spawn's body and soul, feeding them and passing on a lifetime of knowledge. During this time, they eat no more than a grain of rice per day and refrains almost completely from liquids. When the children are ready to part, the parents will drink an embalming fluid, mummifying themselves in silk. They slowly lose their sentience, peacefully drifting into non-existence.

**Siblings as family.**
Before leaving the cave, the larvae will pay tribute to their now dead parents, re-sealing their cradle to turn it into a tomb. The oths then travel together, forging a strong familiar bond between siblings. They may part ways in the future, but the bond they share is never truly broken.

**Educated by experience.**
Through generational learning, oths are wise and prudent creatures from a very young age. However, it's in an oth's nature to cultivate this wisdom with a contemporary and personal viewpoint of the world, and most spend their youth seeking knowledge. Some become scholars, pontificating on the nature of life and knowledge, while others turn into travelers, nurturing their minds with experience and acquiring knowledge by facing the challenges of the world.

## Names
Upon laying eggs, parents takes the task of naming each of their children in their larval stage, usually borrowing sounds from [fruenese](../languages/index.md#shamabic-family). These names will often change on a whim, and are settled only after their death. Oths don't use family names, recognizing their relatives by sight alone.

A list of commonly used names is:
Ala, Alin, Arish, Atifa, Diya, Eman, Fedele, Hashim, Ignethia, Ipolito, Larra, Ligri, Mansor, Naima, Narr, Raman, Rana, Salil, Sanya, Sham, Sairo, Tei, Yines

\section{Dust Kin} \label{kin::oth}
\DndDropCapLine{T}{he light beckons, and you follow.}
\textit{As the light lead you once, now you are guided by enlightenment.
With each hidden truth you uncover, you learn more of what the world is, and how to secure your place in it.
Secrets are your power and your currency.
Seek them out, and guard them well.}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Ancient Moonborn saying.

Moody and perplexing.
Isolated and elegant.
Tough and passionate.
The ways in which one might describe the dust kin are many.
The dust kin, oths, or szua-tlekeloo rlue are a quiet species with a tendency towards nature and knowledge.
They're a solitary yet intimate creature with a penchant for nature and ritual.

\subsection*{Enigmatic and Uncanny}
    While oths can be see as much as gats or irds around civilized lands, they are far more mysterious and reclusive than the two.
    Often silent, oths have a reputation for being cryptic and thoughtful.
    They tend to follow their intuition on a whim.

    Oths usually travel with a large scroll in their backs made from their own fabric, which they protect with impermeable and resilient guards.
    This scroll is a compendium of knowledge passed down through generations, and they add to it in key moments in their life.

    The dust kin have large, heavy forewings that hang around their humanoid bodies like cloaks, which hide a shorter and more delicate set of hindwings behind them.
    They have two sets of arms, one above the other.
    The upper pair is strong and long, while the lower one is weak, and mostly left for secondary tasks.
    Their feet have three fingers and their arms have four, with one being an opposable thumb.
    They have an insectoid face with antennae and compound eyes.
    Their body is covered in a short, fluffy hair which is usually of a very pale brown color.

\subsection*{Long Tempers}
    Through generational learning, oths are wise and prudent creatures from a very early age.
    Many chase intellectual or mindful pursuits, becoming librarians and philosophers.
    They pontificate on the nature of life and knowledge.
    Most think that the oth are naturally intelligent, and take their opinions with very high regard.

    While most dedicate to cultivating their cognition, some decide to live their lives in adventure.
    They nurture their minds with experience, acquiring knowledge via facing the challenges of the world.

    A common thread throughout the race is that they are slow to anger.
    Regardless of culture, it is instilled in them as early as the larval stage.
    Life is too short to be spent in anger or frustration.

\subsection*{Cycle of Resurrection}
    An oth knows when their natural death approaches, and faces it peacefully.
    When they are near their death, they say their goodbyes and withdraws from civilized society.
    The oth then pilgrimages towards a cavern or secret place they designated during their lifetime.

    On arrival, the oth blocks all but one entrance to this sacred place, and lays ten to twenty eggs in a bed of silk during fall.
    They then spend their time gathering foodstuffs and lining the walls, floor, and roof with silk, providing a safe environment for their descendants to develop in.
    The oth also uses this time to finish writing their compendium of knowledge in their scroll, developing it until its ready to be passed on to their strongest descendant.

    At the last week before the break of summer, the oth closes the last entrance to its sacred place, engulfing it in total darkness.
    And they wait.

    At some point during summer, the eggs hatch for their parent to greet and nourish their newborn larvae.
    They dying oth hands qualars to their progeny, teaching them their language and the way of the world.
    Along with this they pass on the tenets of their culture.
    The parent eats no more than a grain of rice per day, and refrains almost completely from liquids.

    Six months after hatching, the younglings go through the process of pupation, remaining as pupa for a year.
    The parent uses this time to drink an embalming fluid, and mummifies themselves in silk.
    They slowly lose their sentience, peacefully drifting into non-existence.

    After hatching, the oths pay tribute to their now dead parent, and re-seal their cradle.
    The first place they see becomes their parent's final resting place.
    The oths then travel together, forming a small familiar tribe which lasts until they reach maturity.
    While the members of the family may part ways, the bond they share is never truly broken.

\subsection*{Educated by Experience}
    Due to the way the oths spend their youths, they are generally very wise from a very young age, blessed with the knowledge of the previous generations.
    However, it's in an oth's nature to cultivate this wisdom with a contemporary and personal viewpoint of the world.
    It's rare to see an oth not spending much of their youth traveling for knowledge and wisdom.
    % The dust kin is also very concerned about the preservation of nature, and are experts at recording its sights and dwellers in great detail.

\subsection*{Oth Names}
    In oth culture, the parent is assigned the task of naming each of their children in their larval stage.
    These names will often change at the whim of the parent, not becoming official until pupation.
    Their names are often difficult to pronounce by the other kins, and most don't mind being called by a nickname for simplicity.
    The dust kin doesn't use family names, recognizing their relatives by sight alone.

    \paragraph{Names}

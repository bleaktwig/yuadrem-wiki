# Imates
[Om](../religions/tanethism_pantheon.md#om) created imates to defend the oric god from [Et](../religions/tanethism_pantheon.md#et) and the [humes](hume.md) in the War of Spring<!-- TODO. Link. -->. While not particularly suited for war, the kin defended their god-tree until the Schism<!-- TODO. Link. -->. For this, they were Blessed with Word. After the burning of Om, imates escaped genocide by migrating to the south, spreading thorough the southern reaches of Yuadrem.

## Physical Description
Imates share some resemblance with humes. Both kins poise the bulk of their weight on two legs, have the same number of digits, and are able to express their emotions through facial expression. However, the body of an imate is covered in hair, which ranges in color from white, through many shades of brown, to black. Lacking the gats' Blessing of Color, no hints of Red or Yellow is seen in their hair. Then, a common trait to all imates are their very large ears, which are surrounded by a tuft of white hair.

Imates are separated into two very different species: the oras and the arsets. Oras have larger bodies. An average adult stands at around 2 meters upright, but they would struggle to maintain this posture for long. Hunched, they're not usually taller than a meter and a half. They have strong bodies and long arms, and often weight more than 100 kg.

Arsets are small in comparison, usually not reaching more than 90 cm in length and 15 kg in weight. While they are not as strong as the oras, they have longer claws and a long, striped tail, both of which they use to climb with great dexterity.

Imates are considered adults at around 10 years, and tend to live to be around 70 and 80 years. As they age, their hair changes color to display particular signatures, thanks to the Blessing of Word. This, in addition to maintaining the strength of elder imates, extends their natural age in a manner similar to hume sorcerers.

## Clothing and accessories
Due to their fur and proclivity to warm and humid weathers, imates in general do not cover their bodies in clothing. It is common to just wear a loincloth, but some include more fabrics with a purely aesthetic purpose. Imate shamans are the exception: as tattooing their body would not be too effective, they wear long ribbons of fabric with apomantic signatures, forming circuits<!-- TODO. I need a better word than "circuit". --> around their bodies. While they cannot switch between circuits as fast as tattooed hume sorcerers, this system allows them to change the signature sets with ease.

For self expression, imates wear an abundance of accessories, often made of copper or gold. Common examples include bands in the arms and legs, rings, and braid rings. Piercings in the face and ears are the sign of adulthood in the kin. These accessories are often made of bone, wood, copper, or gold, and imates puts more value in the complexity of the design than the material from which it was made.

## Origins and history
After the Schism, imates were left without the canopy of Om to protect them. As such, they settled south of the Turtle Sea, surviving the 40-Year Famine thanks to the abundant flora of the area. These settlements were short lived, however, as after recovering from the famine, gats took to hunting imates en masse, sparking the Babaian Genocide.

The imates that survived continued migrating south, settling in a variety of regions on the southernmost reaches of Yuadrem. Many gained an affinity with the yellow god-tree Uld, who lives in the Wildlands. Others migrated to the southernmost points of the continent, and a large group to the Ironlakes Islands.

Contact was lost with most of the groups after The Penance. No signs of imates were sign up until 731 A.S., when they sailed in ships from Gronselar<!-- TODO. Link. -->, towards the islands of the Turtle Sea. They expelled the humes in the Lesser Omian War<!-- TODO. Link. -->, reclaiming their historic territory around Om. Over time, however, many refused this conflict, and settled in the territories surrounding the sea.

## Culture and traditions
**Village as family.**
Imates have fully communal families. An imate will usually not know who their particular parents are, and they regard the village in which they were born as their family. When a family grows too large, it will often split. In this process, the mother family will remain in the old village, while the daughter family embarks on a journey to settle.

An imate's family is for life. Adoption in general only occurs between mother and daughter families, and even in this context it is rare.

**Dual dwellings.**
Traditional imate villages consist of two room styles. The larger are wood and fiber circular huts, built on the trunks of trees. These are used for storage and to house adult oras<!--, who are too large to easily climb the canopies -- TODO. Are they tho? -->. Where the dirt allows, patches of farmland surround these huts, and are worked by the oras.

Then, the branches of the same trees are covered in interconnected chambers, built from weaving grass and plant fibers. Three types of these arboreal rooms exist: shared housing for adult arsets, nurseries for all imate younglings, and farming rooms. In these last ones, arsets leave a mixture of chewed leaves and bark, growing mushrooms from otherwise inedible foraged material.

In Fesh, it is common to see one or two of these arboreal communities inside towns and villages. While historical differences still rift the kins, the Penance has forced the formation of these mixed communities.

**Death and return to Om.**
It is a common belief that a dead imate's soul can only return to Om if its body rots under the earth. Imates traditionally bury their dead below their farmlands, and thus the huts of the oras serve to mourn the recently dead.

For this reason, imates are very reacious to the barkskin<!-- TODO. Link + namechange. --> cycle of birth, since it retards their process of reunification with their god. Furthermore, burning a dead body is extreme sacrilege. If an imate dies by burning or in any way that won't allow its body to rot, as the their soul will never find their way back to Om.

**Specialized roles.**
Due to their differences, oras and arsets tend to take different roles in their society. Arsets, being small and mobile, hunt, scout, and trade with neighboring villages. Oras, larger and stronger, defend the village, along with tending plantations, attending the young, and crafting items and accessories. Traditionally, one or more oras act as the village shamans, conducting rites and communing with the recently dead.
<!-- NOTE. The building of a village is a collective task. -->

**Tradition and Tanethism.**
Imate tradition follows the belief in the divinity of the tree-gods and their relation to the Ring of Color<!-- TODO. Link. -->. They associate the god-trees to the six world signatures<!-- TODO. I should explain this in the cosmology page... -->, and have unique signatures for each of the seven trees<!-- NOTE. Draw these signatures whenever I work on the imate apomantic system. -->. In general they don't place Om above the other god-trees, but they do praise their dead god more than the others.

While many have adapted to Tanethism, their traditional cosmology does not recognize the Mevic Gods<!-- TODO. Link. --> as the makers of the tree-gods. They do, however, recognize Pheter<!-- TODO. Link. --> and Nix<!-- TODO. Link. --> as the forces of creation, and recognize the connection that Illuminants<!-- TODO. Link. --> have with Pheter.

## Names
<!-- TODO. Rework babazano a bit. Keep the silliness and the consonants, but try to adapt some avshenesian/frisian words to it. Also, very old words have repeated syllables, but it's not so common anymore. -->
Imates speak Babazano, the only language in the [omian family](../index.md#omian-family). As such, their names are usually in this language. During their childhood, an imate will be assigned many names by their family members, usually based on distinctive features and particular accomplishments. They will settle on a name of their choice as they reach adulthood, often picking their favorite one from their assigned names.

Imates also have a second name, which is inherited from their family. This is the name of the village in which they were born, adding the prefix *do*, which translates literally to "name". Imates that go through adoption are expected to keep their original village name.

A few common names are:
Anana, Baba, Badaze, Ebezu, Ezevu, Ezeze, Nenuzu, Nono, Nuzu, Ododo, Odozu, Ovozu, Uvu, Uvozu, Veve, Vevozu, Vovo, Zazu, Zenuvu.

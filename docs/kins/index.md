# Ethnology
The peoples of Yuadrem are separated into four distinct "kins". A kin is defined as a sentient species created by a [god-tree](../religion/index#god-trees), and each is divided into many groups by ethnic differences. These differences led to the formation of tribes, kingdoms, and empires during the [Age of Spring](../history#age-of-spring), the erosion of which led to the chiefdoms and sumis<!--TODO:LINK---> of today.

Different events in prehistory and history have caused many migrations and diasporas, but none can be compared to the [Penance](../history#age-of-sap). In the face of the vast loss of landmass to tides of nix, peoples from all origins and ethnicities have coalesced into the Fesh Peninsula<!--TODO:LINK--->.

[**Humes**](hume), born from [Et](../religion/godtrees/et), were the first kin to step upon the world. As pliable as their creator, the have been the most numerous and predominant of the peoples since the [Schism](../history.md#war-of-autumn), a position they maintain even after the Penance.

[**Imates**](imate) were created by [Om](../religion/godtrees/om) to defend itself against humes during the [War of Autumn](../history#war-of-autumn). Decimated by the war and the many posterior massacres, they've proven themselves to be a deceptively sturdy people.

[**Oths**](oth) are a moth-like kin of quiet people with a natural tendency towards knowledge. Created by the colorless [god-tree Tol](../religion/godtrees/tol), they're often recognized as enigmatic as their creator.

[**Elves**](elf) are bone and wood golems gifted life by [Tek](../religion/godtrees/tek), the Green god-tree. While contact between them and the other kins was sparse during the Age of Spring, they've established trade and created conflicts with them after the [Landing of Drejek](../history#age-of-sap)

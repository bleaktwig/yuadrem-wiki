# Barkskin
**TODO. BASICS.**

---
## Physical Description
The barkskin spawn from the corpses of humanoids exposed to the tekust spore.
The spore comes from the Tek tree, and is of a bright orange coloration.
The tekust seals the body and stops its decomposition.
It then grows into moss, merging with the corpse's flesh.
A thick layer of bark replaces the decomposing skin, hence the name of the kin.
After a period of about two months, the corpse rises again, this time in the shape of a barkskin.

The height and build of a barkskin depends considerably on their birth corpse.
Their skin is typically of a healthy brown and green coloration, often covered by a layer of flora.
Their eyes gain a yellowish color, which partially hides the original iris.

Barkskins often take great care over the flora that grows on their body.
They'll remove flowers they don't like, prune plants to their desired length, and shape growths to mold their personal garden.
Some choose to keep their bark sterile, or even grow edible moss and fungi.

In the vicinity of Tek, a barkskin is virtually immortal.
As long as they remain within the reach of its hyphae, they won't age, and need very little food to survive.
This ends when they leave the network -- the tekust in their bodies is not enough to stave off rot.
Detached barkskins often have a lifespan of only a few decades.

## Culture
**TODO.**

### Traditions and Religion
**Birth.**
As part of the process where tekust takes over a body, the newborn barkskin communes with Tek for the first time.
The god-tree teaches the barkskin knaenese along with the tenets of their society.
While its uncommon, some barkskins are born outside of Tek's hyphan network.
They lack this innate connection, and most become unable to commune with the tree.

**Adulthood and Families.**
A group of barkskins become adults when they form a family.
To do this, the would-be family must commune with Tek.
Through a shaman, the tree god chooses the chief of the family.
The shaman then carves holes into the chief's thyroid cartilage, gifting their voice with a characteristic whistling noise.

After the chief heals, the group travels to the northern lakes of Drejek to hunt a ueuee.
Ueuees are huge frog-like monsters that prey on humes.
While ueuees are fierce beasts, they are often afraid of the barkskin whistles.
Any group that succeeds in cutting a ueuee's tongue are accepted as a family, and the members are considered adults.

Families usually start with around twenty to thirty barkskins.
They often shrink rapidly after the adulthood ritual, as many join civilization or forge a path of their own.
A barkskin may do with their life as they please, and only need the approval of Tek if they aim to join another family.

**Death.**
Upon death, a barkskin's corpse feeds the ground and spreads the tekust spore.
A family may react in one of two ways, depending on the context.
If the risk of tekust infecting a hume is real, the corpse is burned summarily.
The barkskin's bones are then burned to condense its pheter, as is traditional among humes.
Otherwise, the body is left to rot.
Natural processes return the nutrients of the body to the earth, as Tek returns what they once borrowed.

**Tekism and Tanethism.**
Most barkskins native to Drejek follow the tekist philosophy, which combines religion and philosophical reasoning.
While the mode of thinking is somewhat compatible of Tanethism, there are some major differences regarding their divinities.
They believe in the tree gods and their relation to the Ring of Color, but not on the other orders of gods.
They think of the illuminants as powerful shamans, rather than divine beings.

Tekists attain knowledge to later give it to Tek.
They see themselves as a detached part of the god-tree, and await their eventual return.
They also commune with Tek through meditation and the consumption of nahan <!-- NOTE. I-water in knaenese -->, a strong psychedelic made by fermenting the sap of the god-tree.

### Origins and History
Barkskins were created by the tree god Tek in Drejek.
The year in which this happened is unknown, but it is known that the first barkskins were made from corpses of the ird diaspora. <!-- TODO. Mention the ird diaspora (four ird migrations) in History. Maybe even an ird diaspora map would be cool? Simple one made from the world map, with arrows pointing to all the movement! -->
The original barkskins built only basic houses and structures.
They lived alongside Tek, and dedicated their lives to the health and growth of Drejek.

Barkskins were originally reserved, and did not interact with humes until the year 141 A.S.
The irds of the qul archipelago sought to build communities in Drejek, but were quickly repelled by the barkskins.
This relationship never cooled, and this extended to the Seven Principates -- no alliance was established between the jungle dwellers and the greater world.

After the Penance, Tek and the barkskins were thought to be lost to Nix.
This was proved wrong in 734 A.S.
Tek detached a large part of Drejek, and dragged it through the nix to the Fesh Peninsula.
The landmass collided with the Punica Peaks, now forming the Drejek Highlands.

The contact sparked the Landfall War<!-- TODO. workshop name. -->, a short conflict between the barkskin and **TODO** Kingdom.
With the end of the war, relationships between them and the humes cooled for the first time.
<!-- The kin are now collaborating with humes, both seeking to fight against the spread of nix. -->
While access to the jungle core and Tek themself is still forbidden, humes are allowed to the Highlands.
In addition, there exists some barkskin immigration toward the Peninsula proper.
<!-- It's not uncommon to see a small populace of that ethnicity in villages. -->

### Names
A barkskin is born without a name, and remain nameless most of their youth.
They decide on a name when they join a potential family in the adulthood ritual.
These names are usually in knaenese, a language famously hard to pronounce.
It's not uncommon for the other kins to call them by a nickname or a simplified version of the name.

A non-exhaustive list of common names would be:
Gantauda, Gesunt, Gunsedant, Hanhant, Hanseek needa, Hantadage, Huntge, Keena, Kegunseeda, Knaetseeknan, Knandage, Knudu, Kueqan, Nade, Naekuntge, Nega, Nelati, Seetun, Tsaegae, Tsege, Tsehant, Ukena.

## Geographic Distribution
The majority of the barkskin live in the Drejek Highlands.
Some population groups have formed inside hume villages.
The largest of these are **TODO**.
It is unknown if other settlements exist outside of the peninsula.

<!-- TODO. Draw a map of the movement of the barkskin out of Drejek and mark large barkskin population centers. Reference Na'ane stuff. -->

### Subgroups
**TODO.**

<!--
The moss kin, or naenks, are moss creatures that hunt in the dark, warm, and wet jungles of Drejek.
They hunt for sustenance and to gather fresh corpses.

\subsection*{Call to Adventure}
    A naenk rarely leaves the Drejek jungle in which they are born.
    However, many reasons can spark the need for a naenk or an entire band to abandon their home.
    A band may leave engaging on a quest, as commanded by Tekatsae itself, or in shame after failing in one.
    The most common bands abandoning the tribe are those that failed on their initiation rite, culled by the vicious whowie.

    While in groups they may be savage, individual naenks are not completely insensitive people.
    It is not too rare for a naenk to abandon their tribe in search for a different life.
    Discontent with their chief, tiredness from their class system, or mere curiosity of the outside world count among the most common reasons for a naenk to travel by themselves.

    % Only known among the naenk and the tsanek is the fact that a huge qualar lies inside the tree itself, which imbues the colossal plant with sentience.
    % How this object ended up inside the tree is unknown, but it is thought among them that the tall one cter-rheth is looking to recover it.
    % Due to the fact that the kin can't reproduce by themselves, they protect the tree with their lives and, under normal circumstances, won't allow anyone to even approach it.

    There is an old legend of a courageous band that will one day sneak into Ctereth's lair and steal a huge bounty of qualars.
    These will be used to grow a second tree, brother to Tekatsae, improving the kin's survival by a large margin.
    Many groups have tried to become this band of legend, but none has returned thus far.

\subsection*{Traits}
    Your naenk character has an assortment of abilities, relating to their nature and surroundings.

    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

    \subparagraph{Age} A naenk typically lives at most 30 years.
    They are naturally mature right after being born and usually take less than a month to adapt to their society.

    \subparagraph{Alignment} Naenks are organized creatures, used to following the rules of their communities.
    Most tend towards the silver tide, especially those who haven't gained a name yet.

    \subparagraph{Size} The moss kin come in very varied shapes and sizes.
    They stand a tiny bit smaller than their birth corpse, but weight about half.
    Your size and anatomy varies greatly depending on your birth corpse. \label{kin::naenk.size}

    \subparagraph{Speed} Your base walking speed is 6 meters.

    \subparagraph{Dual Nature} You are both humanoid and plant.

    \subparagraph{Naenk claws} Because of your sharp claws, you have a base climbing speed of 6 meters.
    In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.
    If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

    \subparagraph{Eat by Osmosis} While naenks prefer to eat meat by nature, you can mostly live off nutrients from the ground.
    When in fertile land, you only need to eat once per week.
    You can also eat more often if you choose to do so.

    \subparagraph{Languages} You can speak, read, and write knaenese.
    You can also speak, read, and write other language of your choice, but your pronunciation leaves much to be desired.

    % Despite their lack of lips, the moss kin does speak a language, which is named Knaenese.
    % Knaenese is a very simple, accommodating to their impaired speech.
    % While a naenk can learn other languages, their pronunciation usually leaves much to be desired.

    \subparagraph{Subraces} Naenks are most easily separated by their home - Gannag or Na'ane.

    The most common of their kin, Gannagian naenks are the members of the tribes that surround the Tekatsae tree.
    They have a very strong sense of community and an excellent capacity to work as a team.
    Any one naenk will easily give their life without second thought for their people and for their way of life.

    While all naenks are capable fighters, Gannagian naenk take on different jobs to fulfill different tasks.
    The most common of these are the warriors, the hunters, and the gatherers.
    Your subrace traits depend on which of these roles you take.

\subsubsection{Gannagian Warrior}
    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Your Strength score increases by one.

    \subparagraph{Moldy Companion} As part of a long rest, you may contaminate a recently deceased beast with nanust spores.
    To do this, you must succeed on a medicine ability check of DC 8 + the creature's number of hit dice.
    If you succeed, the spores will settle into the beast, and the corpse rises as your nuen at the end of the long rest.

    The nuen has the stats, abilities, and actions of the original beast, but its hit points and hit dice are cut in half.
    It acts on its own volition and on its own initiative turn, but you can use an action to issue an order to it, which it follows to the best of its abilities.
    It also gains the Plant Camouflage trait (page \pageref{trait::plantcamouflage}).

    When traveling with one or more gannagian warriors, only the naenk with the highest Wisdom score can use this trait.

    \subparagraph{Combat Training} The damage die of your claws is increased from a d4 to a d6.
    Additionally, you can choose to add your Dexterity bonus rather than your Strength bonus to your attack and damage rolls.
    % Trained and proficient in combat, you know the first rank of the \textbf{Armed Fighter} feat (page \pageref{feat::armedfighter}).

\subsubsection{Gannagian Hunter}
    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Your Constitution score increases by one.

    \subparagraph{Plant Camouflage} You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make while in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life. \label{trait::plantcamouflage}

    \subparagraph{Hunter's Guts} You are competent in the Survival skill.
    Additionally, your base climbing speed is increased to 9.

\subsubsection{Gannagian Gatherer}
    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Your Intelligence score increases by one.

    \subparagraph{Darkvision} Gatherers spend most of their life recollecting fungus underground, which provides you with an increased awareness in the dark.
    You can see in dim light within 12 meters of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
    You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

    \subparagraph{Seedspeech} Through sounds and touch, you can communicate simple ideas to living plants, and are able to interpret their responses as simple language.
    Plants do not perceive the world in terms of sight, but most can feel differences in temperature, describe things that have touched them, as well as hear vibrations that happened around them (including speech).

\subsubsection{Na'anian Naenk}
    Among the naenks that grow disillusioned with their tribes, many choose to pack their possessions and leave.
    Among these self-exiled naenks, most usually choose to join the neighboring nation of Na'ane to live with their tsanek brothers.

    These naenks drink a special beverage upon arrival known as nahan cooked by the nations sovereigns.
    % NOTE. Nahan literally means "I-water" in Knaenese.
    Nahan weakens the bond of the naenk with the Tekatsae tree, forcing them to attain a qualar to remain sentient.
    % As a side effect, it also extends the naenk's life, pushing it to about 50 years.

    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} You are learned the way of the tsaneks, and your Wisdom score increases by one.

    \subparagraph{Rapport Spores} Your time among the tsaneks has allowed your body to adapt, and fungal growths are found all around your body.
    You can extend rapport spores in a 4.5 meter radius as an action.
    These spores go around corners and affect any creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or more that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals.
    Creatures affected by the spores realize the effect immediately, but those outside of range cannot notice it.
    Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they remain within 6 meters of each other.
    The effect lasts for 15 minutes.

    \subparagraph{Noxious Spores} When a creature touches or hits you with a melee attack, you can choose to secrete noxious spores as a reaction.
    The creature takes 1d6 poison damage if it isn't undead, construct, or elemental.
    You can use this skill a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
    After expending all uses, you can't use this trait again until you complete a short rest.

\section{Fungal Kin} \label{kin::tsanek}
\DndDropCapLine{I}{ done seen some things down there.}
\textit{There be cities grander than any of gat's make, holdin' creatures stranger than the harrowing immensity isself.
There be ungodly abominations that weren't never meant to see the light o' day.
And there be... there be mushrooms! An entire city of mushrooms!}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Blim, the Na'anian chronicles.

% Apart from its chief, every unit has a designated tsanek shaman.
% This tsanek is mainly in charge of communicating with the other tsaneks in faraway places, aiding in the coordination of the tribe as a whole.
% Apart from this and other ceremonial tasks, the shaman acts as a normal member of the unit.

% The highest ranking members of their society are the sovereigns and elder sovereigns, who are tsaneks that reached their final stage of development.
% The former are huge mobile tsaneks that take root in strategic positions in Drejek to establish their complex communication network.
% The latter are the eldest in the tribe, and merge with Tekatsae itself.
% They directly speak to the tree, communicating its wishes to the sovereigns and shamans via their root network.

Also known as tsaneks in the naenk tongue, the fungal kin is a species of intelligent fungi creature that inhabit swamps, forests, and caverns.
They are commonly seen in the jungle of Drejek, as members of the tribes near the tekatsae tree.
Like the naenks, tsaneks grow from the tree itself, starting out as small russet-colored fungi in the tree's base and exposed roots, until they're able to grow legs and emerge.
Unlike the naenks, the fungal kin are capable of reproducing by themselves, and it's very common to find independent tsanek communities in the darker reaches of Yuadrem.

Tsaneks generally deplore violence, and only attack when provoked.
If approached peacefully, they gladly provide shelter or passage through their colonies.

\subsection*{Tribal Life}
    Most tsaneks belong to the tribes of Drejek, filling the roles of shamans and diplomats that the naenks are less likely to fulfill due to their violent nature.
    They are considered above their mossy companions in their social circles, and are generally treated with respect among them.

    When a tsanek reaches 100 years, it is put through the rite of growth.
    The tsanek must ceremoniously consume a mixture of the sap of tekatsae, wyvernroot, and water of the boiling river. % Wyvernroot is a strong poisonous plant native to Drejek.
    Next, it must enter a chamber of awareness, which are small caverns below tekatsae.
    The tsanek is only left out after a month in isolation.
    Most of the tsaneks that go through this ritual die, and are consumed by tekatsae, bringing them back to the tree.
    The ones that don't become the highest ranking members of their tribal societies: Sovereigns.
    Tsanek sovereigns are large, malformed creatures that reign over the tribes.
    They are the only creatures capable of directly speaking with tekatsae, and thus are the only that can communicate its wishes to the tribes.

\subsection*{Circles and Melds}
    Many tsaneks, feeling unprepared, leave the tribes before this ritual.
    Usually many more of their species follow them to start independent communities as exiles.
    Over a timeframe of 300 to 400 years, the eldest from these colonies naturally grow to become sovereigns themselves, presiding over many social groups called circles.
    A circle consists of twenty or more fungal kin that work, live, and meld together.

    Melding is prohibited in the Drejek tribal communities, but is a regular practice in these circles.
    A meld is a form of communal meditation that allows tsaneks to transcend their sometimes dull existence.
    Their rapport spores bind the participants into a group consciousness, inducing a shared dream that provides entertainment and social interaction.
    Tsaneks use melding in the pursuit of higher consciousness, collective union, and spiritual apotheosis.
    They can also use their rapport spores to communicate telepathically with other sentient creatures.

\subsection*{Tsanek Reproduction}
    Like other fungi, tsanek reproduce by mundane sporing.
    They are the only race that can retain their sentience without qualar, but if their spores grow without the influence of tekatsae or a particularly old sovereign, the sprouting quickly becomes feral, unable to retain sentience.
    Due to this, tsaneks carefully control their spores' release.

    Tsaneks are known to feel very little connection to their offspring.
    Among the tribal tsaneks, the children of their species are taken care of by a few tsanek designated as the spore-caretakers.
    Among the exiles, child rearing becomes a responsibility shared by the entire circle.
    It is rare if young tsaneks can even identify their parents.

\subsection*{Call to Adventure}
    While many tsanek are needed in the tribes near tekatsae for managerial tasks, it is not unusual for some to travel the globe to learn.
    Most focus their study on the qualar and cter'rheth, bringing this knowledge back to their tribes.

    Cavern tsaneks regularly travel the many caves below Yuadrem, and some even settle outside of their colonies, most usually in dark gat cities.
    Some have founded libraries, laboratories, and monasteries, usually along oths, and dedicate their lives to research and education.

\subsection*{Tsanek Names}
    Due to the fact that tsaneks have no verbal language, their names are most appropriately translated as physical descriptions of a particular individual.

    \paragraph{Names}
    Bolete, Brownback, Buttonhead, Greenfoot, Morel, Mossy, Portabelt, Puffball, Redstem, Soft-Step, Stinkhorn, Toad.

    Your size is medium.

    \subparagraph{Speed} Your base walking speed is 6 meters.

    \subparagraph{Age} Individual tsanek are not known to die of old age, and the most elder can live to become a sovereign of one or more circles, living indefinitely longer.
    Sproutings take a long time to fully mature, but it's a continuous process and even the oldest tsaneks seem to continue growing, albeit slowly.

    \subparagraph{Alignment} Most often, a tsanek believes strongly in society and law.
    It is extremely uncommon for a tsanek to directly attack any creature that does not mean it, or its circle, harm.
    Most fungal kin groups and circles dedicate their lives to knowledge, and have a tendency towards the blue tide.

    \subparagraph{Nonverbal Magic} Though you have no conventional language, you can ignore the verbal component of spells.

    \subparagraph{Rapport Spores} All creatures within 3 meters of you with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals can communicate telepathically with you and with each other if you speak at least one language in common.
    You can suppress this ability at will.
    Creatures affected by the spores realize the effect immediately, but those outside of range cannot notice them.
    Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they remain within 6 meters of each other.

    \subparagraph{Pacifying Spores} \label{kin::tsanek.pacifyingspores}
    As two actions, you can eject spores at one creature you can see within 1 meters of you.
    The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute.
    The spell save DC for this effect is 8 + your Constitution modifier.
    Undead, constructs, and elementals automatically succeed on this save.
    The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    After using this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest.

    \subparagraph{Hallucination Spores} As an action, you can produce spores that affect all creatures within 6 meters of you that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals.

    \end{DndTable}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Gannagian Tsanek}
    Fungal kin that are members of the tribes in Drejek which surround tekatsae.
    Like their mold kin brothers, they have a very strong sense of community and devotion to their groups, the sovereigns and the tekatsae tree.
    They are the spiritual leaders of the different groups, and focus on coordinating the tribes and communicating with the sovereigns.

    \subparagraph{Euphoria Spores} Accustomed to fighting with the naenk warriors, you can release a specialized cloud of spores in a 6-meter-radius sphere centered on yourself.
    Other creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw of a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier or become poisoned for 1 minute.
    A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect early on itself on a success.
    When the effect ends, the creature gains one level of exhaustion.
    You can produce these spores a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per long rest.

\subsubsection{Na'anian Tsanek}
    Sometimes, a tsanek will decide to abandon the tribe and break its link with the tekatsae tree.
    These tsanek, unable to forgo their community lifestyles, tend to join or form fungus kin communities in the caverns of the world, sometimes spawning huge underground fungus cities.

    \subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Your meandering in hostile environments has granted you increased resilience, and your Constitution score is increased by 1.

    \subparagraph{Sun Sickness} You become poisoned if you spend more than 1 minute in direct, unobstructed sunlight.
    This conditions ends when you spend 1 minute in dim or dark conditions.

    \subparagraph{Superior Darkvision} Accustomed to the darkness of the deepest of caverns, you have superior darkvision in dark and dim conditions.
    You can see in dim light within 24 meters of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

    \subparagraph{Meld} \label{kin::tsanek.meld}
    When you take a short rest in the presence of one or more other tsaneks, you can meld with them.
    After melding, you and all melding tsaneks regain all expended Hit Dice and gain the following benefits:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You have advantage on a saving throw you make in the next 24 hours.
        \item You can end one disease or condition affecting you, be it blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
    \end{itemize}

    \subparagraph{Communal Intellect} Your time spent melding with the others of your kin has granted you a deeper understanding of the world and yourself.
    You are competent in the Insight and Religion skills, and you have advantage on Wisdom (survival) checks made to find your way in caverns.

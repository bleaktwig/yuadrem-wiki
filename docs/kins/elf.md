# Elves
The god-tree [Tek](../religion/godtrees/tek.md) created elves during the [War of Autumn](../history.md#war-of-autumn) using [ird](hume.md#ird-culture) corpses that were left behind during the [Ird Diaspora](../history.md#war-of-autumn). The original elves didn't interact with the larger world and were mostly unknown, with only myth surrounding their existence. They lived alongside their parent tree, dedicating their lives to the health and growth of the rainforests of Drejek<!--TODO:LINK--->.

Most elves live in the Drejek Highlands<!--TODO:LINK--->, where they established the sumi<!--TODO:LINK---> of Gannag<!--TODO:LINK---> and keep a peaceful relation with the neighboring chiefdoms and sumis. Recently, however, many of the kin separated from their god-tree, founding the sumi of Knagan<!--TODO:LINK---> in the Great Riwe Plateau<!--TODO:LINK--->. These are violent, and engage in constant battles with the peoples nearby. Finally, a few elves have settled alongside [humes](hume.md) and [imates](imate.md), forming a strange yet fruitful relationship between the kins.

## Physical description
Elves spawn from recently-dead humanoids who are exposed to tekust, a bright-orange spore that comes from Tek. The spore seals the body and stops its decomposition, growing into a moss that merges with its flesh. Bark hardens and replaces the decomposing skin, shaping the body into an elf in a span of time of 6 months to 2 years, depending on the size of the carcass and the environmental conditions.

The height and build of an elf depends on their birth corpse, mimicking its bone structure while being somewhat thinner than the body's previous owner. Their skin is typically of a healthy brown and green coloration, often covered by a layer of flora and fungi. Their eyes gain a yellowish color, which partially hides the iris.

In the vicinity of Tek, an elf is virtually immortal. As long as they remain within the reach of the god-tree's hyphae, they won't age, and need minimal food to survive. This ends when they leave the network, however—the tekust in their bodies alone is not enough to stave off rot. Detached elves often have a lifespan of only a few decades, which they can extend by pilgrimaging to Tek.

## Clothing and accessories
Most elves don't wear any clothing or accessories, choosing to instead tend to the garden on their bodies. Those who integrate into hume society often wear a mask to hide the overgrown skull of their birth corpse. Some introduce other accessories with time, often placing them in conjunction to their garden.

Elves take great care over what grows on their body. They'll remove flowers they don't like, prune plants to their desired length, and shape growths to create their personal garden. Some choose to grow edible moss and fungi, and a few even choose to keep their bark sterile.

## Origins and history
Elves were an isolated kin, and did not have any major interaction with humes until the late fourth century, when the irds of Jenkash<!--TODO:LINK---> sought to colonize Drejek. They were quickly repelled, starting a violent conflict between the two that eventually cooled down into an uneasy yet peaceful alliance. This never extended to the Seven Princedoms<!--TODO:LINK--->—no major contact was ever established between the jungle dwellers and the greater world.

After the [Penance](../history.md#age-of-sap), both Tek and its elves were thought to be lost to [Nix](../religion/primordials/nix.md). This was proved wrong in the [Landing of Drejek](../history.md#age-of-sap), when the inhabitants of the Fesh Peninsula<!--TODO:LINK---> learned that Tek used its roots to detach a large portion of Drejek, slowly dragging it through nix to crash into the Fesh Peninsula. The plateau collided with the Punika Peaks, forming the Drejek Highlands<!--TODO:LINK--->.

<!--TODO:
    * Add the Drejek Highlands (name) to the fesh peninsula map.

The contact sparked a cautious curiosity from the sumi of Fremit<!--TODO:LINK--->, who sent emissaries to the newly formed plateau. The elves, uninterested in conflict, established for the first time an alliance between them and gats. While access to the core of the jungle and Tek itself is forbidden to humes, many small hume communities have formed in the highlands, working together with elves in the fight against Nix.

## Culture and traditions
**Communion at birth.**
As part of the process where tekust takes over a body, the newborn elf communes with Tek for the first time. The god-tree teaches the elf the history and tenets of their society, along with the knowledge of the [gannagian](../languages/index.md#naenkian-family) language. Some elves, especially those from Knagan, are born outside of Tek's hyphan network. They lack this innate connection, and are unable to commune with the god-tree.

Most elves come from the bodies of humes and [oths](oth.md), and their macabre method of reproduction is being slowly integrated into their cultures. Imates, however, as they believe that their soul can only return to Om once their body rots under the earth. Any elf born from an imate would raise immediate concern among them, as the soul would still be trapped in the elf's body, stolen by Tek.

**Adulthood and families.**
A troupe of elves become adults when they form a family, for which they must first commune with Tek. The god-tree chooses the chief of the family through a shaman, who then carves holes into the chief's thyroid cartilage—gifting their voice a characteristic whistle tone.

Traditionally, the group would then travel to hunt a ueuee, a huge frog-like monster that inhabited the jungle of Drejek. While fierce, the creatures were afraid of the chief's whistle, aiding them in combat. Any troupe that cut a ueuee's tongue would've been accepted as a family, and its members reach adulthood. With the displacement of the plateau, however, the monsters are exceedingly rare, and in general groups now hunt whichever large creature is available for game.

Families start with twenty to thirty, but this number tends to shrink rapidly as nowadays many choose to forge their own path or join other civilizations. An elf may do what they please with their life, and only seek the approval of Tek if they aim to join another family.

**Death.**
Upon death, an elf's corpse feeds the ground and spreads the tekust spore. Depending on context, their family might react in one of two ways: if the risk of tekust infecting unwilling hosts is real, the corpse is burned summarily, and the bones are pulverized to condense its pheter, as is traditional among humes; otherwise, the body is left to rot, as natural processes return its nutrients to the earth, as Tek returns what it once borrowed.

**Tekism and Tanethism.**
Like imates, traditional elf cosmology recognizes the divinity of the [god-trees](../religion/index.md#god-trees) but not that of the [mevic gods](../religion/index.md#mevic-gods) or the [two primordials](../religion/index.md#the-two-primordial). They think of [Illuminants](../religion/index.md#illuminants) as powerful shamans, rather than divine beings.

Most elves native to Gannag follow the tekist philosophy, which combines religion and philosophical reasoning. Tekists see themselves as a detached part of their god-tree, and attain knowledge and skill to later return it to Tek. Some also commune with the oric god through asceticism or the consumption of _nahan_—"I-water" in [knaenese](../languages/index.md#naenkian-family)—, a strong psychedelic made by fermenting the sap of the god-tree.

## Names
Am elf is born without a name, and remain nameless through most of their youth. They get to decide on a name when they join a potential family in the adulthood ritual. These names are often in knaenese, a language very hard to pronounce by the other kins, and as such it's not uncommon for elves to gain nicknames or simplified versions of their names.

A non-exhaustive list of common names include:
Gantauda, Gesunt, Gunsedant, Hanhant, Hanseek needa, Hantadage, Huntge, Keena, Kegunseeda, Knaetseeknan, Knandage, Knudu, Kueqan, Nade, Naekuntge, Nega, Nelati, Seetun, Tsaegae, Tsege, Tsehant, Ukena.

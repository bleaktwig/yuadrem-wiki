<!--
TODO LIST:
* Finish this first index page. It's the first thing player see in the wiki!

Yuadrem was first settled by the firstborn oric gods, Et<!-- TODO. Link. --> and Om<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
These two gods were planted by the god of disparity, Pheter<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
Et was a large and thin birch, pliable and adaptable.
Om was a short and stout juniper, vigorous and prodigious.
These two gods were ever locked in combat, yet none could take the upper hand.
This conflict became known as the War of Spring.

To aid in the eternal conflict, Et created the humes<!-- TODO. Link. -->, a kin as pliable and adaptable as the god.
Et bestowed upon humes Apomantics<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and taught them to wage war using Word.
Om in turn created marsets<!-- TODO. Link. -->, a smaller kin able to traverse the forests of Et's children with ease.
The marsets were gifted Chromology<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and fought using Color.

The conflict ended with the burning of Om, an event known as the Schism<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
Pheter, angered by the death of the god, retaliated by striking Et with lightning<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
The blast burned the tree-god, and brought the 40-Year Famine to both humes and marsets.
This event marks the year 0, and the beginning of history.
<!-- NOTE. I should add lotsa links here... -->

<!-- GEOGRAPHY ---------------------------------------------------------------->
## Geography
![Map of Yuadrem](img/world_map_v083.png)

***Pictured:***
*Trade map of Yuadrem, drawn in 604 A.S. by Marim of Avshen under the commission of Olag, the God-Suzerain of Naptane.*
*The region colored in green corresponds to the Seven Protectorates of the Sea.*
*Other colors represent the tax and penalty applied to trade in those regions.*
*This map proves the healthy state of maritime travel and trade in the golden age.*

Yuadrem is a supercontinent, the only such landmass in the world Darhoc.
The topography is varied, split by four different mountain ranges.
Due to its large extension from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the tundras of Stinos to the rainforests of Drejek.

Due to its size, Yuadrem is often divided into six distinct regions: the [Northern Territories](world/northern_territories.md), the [Westlands](world/westlands.md), the [Fractured Lands](world/fractured_lands.md), the [Sunland](world/sunland.md), the [Savage Territories](world/savage_territories.md), and the [Wildlands](world/wildlands.md).
In addition, the four oceans that surround it are:

* The Frigid Ocean to the north-east, which is known for its low temperatures and abundance of migratory idzels<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
* The warm Teal Ocean to the north-west, home to a very varied marine life.
* The Burnt Ocean to the east, surprisingly devoid of activity.
* The Southern Ocean to the south, the least explored of the four.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- DEMOGRAPHY --------------------------------------------------------------->
## Demography
### Population
Back in the golden age, Yuadrem was split into various nations, each with their own population centers and varied economies.
This era of peace lasted until the death of god-suzerain Olag<!-- TODO. Link. -->, an event that sparked the Penance<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
With the nix<!-- TODO. Link. --> unrolling over Yuadrem, population is now separated into islets.

An islet is defined as a region devoid of nix.
Islets come about in one of two ways: A region can be protected by an Illuminant<!-- TODO. Link. --> or another such method, or it can be inaccessible by nix due to its topography.
The largest example of the former is the Fesh Peninsula<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
Many small islets exist thanks to the latter, but the largest ones would be [Krugghom](islets/krugghom/index.md) and the [Steldan Islet](islets/steldan_islet/index.md).
Exploration outside of islets is very limited, and contact between them is rare.

Islets are commonly named either after the region, nation, or state that stood where they now are.
A non-exhaustive list of the current known ones is:

* Fesh Peninsula.
* Wildlands.
* [Krugghom](islets/krugghom/index.md).
* [Steldan Islet](islets/steldan_islet/index.md).

<!-- ETHNOLOGY ---------------------------------------------------------------->
### Ethnology
The peoples of Yuadrem are separated into four distinct kins.
Kins are separated by progeny, and they cannot mix with each other.
All kins are further separated by ethnic differences.
These differences led to the formation of nations, whose erosion later led to the islets.

[Humes](kins/hume.md), born from Et, are as adaptable as their creator.
<!-- They became the dominant kin in Yuadrem after the Schism, and remain in this position even after the Penance. -->
[Marsets](kins/marset.md), born from Om, are hardy nomads that roam the remaining forests of Yuadrem.
[Oths](kins/oths.md) are a moth-like kin, a quiet people with a natural tendency towards knowledge.
[Barkskins](kins/barkskin.md) are bone and wood golems, animated by the god Tek<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

<!-- Ets. --------------------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- Before these modern kins existed, two kins ruled Yuadrem: the ets and the oms.
Ets were a tall hume-like kin who, using the art of *Cthai-thas*, molded their own flesh, and created humes and oths.
Due to their individualist nature, ets never had a population over the few thousands.
Most of them died during The Schism, and the few survivors are though to have been lost in The Penance. -->

<!-- Ets were commonly known as the "tall kin", for they usually stood well beyond 3 meters.
When borm their skin was of a bluish white color, their eyes were as black as the abyss, and were hairless.

The species greatly developed their technology, which was biological in nature.
They were free from aging and illness, and each was capable of shaping their own flesh.
This led to a great variety of characteristics in the many members of the kin.

Ets were obsessed with their individuality.
It was common for one to change their own appearance, molding their flesh to reflect their personality and philosophy.
Despite their longevity, it was rare for new ets to be born.
The kin never grew to more than a few thousand members. -->

<!-- Oms. --------------------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- In contrast, not much is known about oms.
They were nomadic in nature, and are though to have lived simple lifestyles.
Most were slaughtered by ets and humes, in the Three Omian Genocides.
Marsets are the only known descendants of oms, but fragments of their culture also remains on barkskins. -->

<!-- RELIGION ----------------------------------------------------------------->
### Religion
**TODO.**
<!-- \DndDropCapLine{R}{eligion is an important part of life}
of the many cultures of Yuadrem.
Some worship specific pantheons of gods, others praise unpersonified concepts, and a selected few worship nature itself.
% In the times before the schism there was a wide belief that the tall kin could answer prayers, but their worship is now forbidden in most of the continent.

% The true existence of these divinities is a widely discussed subject, but their worship is undeniable.
From the nature-worshiping folk of Jenkash to the god-birds of Krudzal, each culture performs a set of rituals in the name of their deities, and some even claim to be able to channel their divine power.
While it might be hard to pinpoint the exact number of religions in Yuadrem, a few are built into the fabric of civilizations, and are easy to tell apart. -->

[Tanethism](religions/tanethism.md), [Tsalemism](religions/tsalemism.md), [Igneism](religions/igneism.md), [Cosmism](religions/cosmism.md).

A great variety of languages permeate Yuadrem, both of natural spawn and artificial design.
While it is impossible to identify each tongue and its variations, many efforts have been done over the years to classify the common ones.

Based on lexical and grammatical similarities, languages are separated into four generations, and five distinct families.

<!-- % \paragraph{Old Tongue} A very complicated and intricate language spoken by the tall kin, the original settlers of Yuadrem.
% It's spoken form involves various complex articulations and the definition of a word can vary greatly based on the context.
% Additionally, each tall one had their own personal version of the written form, and others would understand it as much as they understood the individual.
% % This makes the reading of the old tongue extremely difficult for the kin that remain in the world, since understanding a particular tall one's scribbles essentially requires understanding their own version of the language.
% % Nowadays, only scholars and archaeologists understand the language, and it is not normally used anywhere.
% \paragraph{Marset Tongue} Every marset is already able to speak this strange, repetitive language.
% The marset tongue only has ten consonants, and ten verbs.
% % The rest of their vocabulary is built up from there, making their language very difficult to speak or understand by kins other than the marsets.
% Marset tongue can be spoken in one of two ways: soundlessly, through lip reading, or screamed as loud as possible, with no middle ground.
% The language cannot be written down.
% \paragraph{Naenk Tongue} Short words and strong consonants define the naenk tongue.
% Lacking lips and teeth, naenks make heavy use of their alveolar ridge and hard palate to produce syllables.
% The written form of the language involves carving lines and holes onto bark or stone.
% \paragraph{Outer Tongue}
% \paragraph{Mind Speech}

% \paragraph{Dust Tongue}
% \paragraph{Ird Tongue}
% \paragraph{Gat Tongue}
% \paragraph{Leafrunes} Very easy to learn, but kept secret by the archer kin.
% A marset will teach this set of runes only to creatures that it deeply trusts, and only if it's strictly necessary.
% Ten leafrunes exist, all of which are used individually and to convey very simple meaning.
% % \textit{colony}, \textit{danger}, \textit{fun place}, \textit{hiding spot}, \textit{observation point}, \textit{predators}, \textit{road}, \textit{sacred place}, \textit{source of food}, and \textit{source of materials}.

<!-- \subsubsection{Language}
The tall kin spoke a very sophisticated language, known as jan-theth rlin, simplified as jantherlin.
This language allowed for a very profound expression of one's emotions and inner state, and is still used in poetry to this date.
For when deeper communication is needed, ets could meld their bodies and share thought, but the practice was only used in special rituals or to express especially complex abstract concepts.

As for written word, it was customary for the tall kin to chisel the stone, commonly carving a great variety of images alongside the text.
While this written language originates from jantherlin, each tall one had its own personal version of it.
Other ets could only comprehend one's writing as much as they understood the writer.
This makes the study of jantherlin extremely difficult to modern archaeologists.
% This makes the reading of the jantherlin extremely difficult for the kin that remain in the world, since understanding a particular tall one's scribbles essentially requires understanding their own version of the language.

## History
**TODO.**

**TODO. Mention Tol and Taneth.**

<!-- PREHISTORY --------------------------------------------------------------->
### Prehistory
* **Nascency of Disparity.**
The primordial Pheter, god of disparity, is born from Nix.
With Pheter comes the separation of land and sea, and thus Yuadrem is created.
* **Nascency of Color.**
From Pheter, the two damic gods are born: Zash, the sun, and Fagal, the darksun.
Zash in turn is divided into his six aspects, the mevic gods, which conform the colors.
* **First Communion.**
To populate Yuadrem, each mevic god plants a seed.
These seeds grow into god-trees, the oric gods.
* **War of Spring.**
The largest of the oric gods, Et and Om, go into war.
While no damic or mevic god interfered, Pheter themself was against the conflict.
Humes are born from Et as soldiers in this war, while Om creates the marsets to defend themself.
<!-- TODO. Add the Ird Diaspora + the first siege of Ctereth. -->
* **The Schism.**
After a long and bloody conflict, Et wins the war against Om.
Under the orders of their god-tree, the gats burn down the god-tree of the marsets.
As the fire spreads, Pheter transforms into lightning, striking down Et.
The ash from the burned god-trees engulfs Yuadrem, sparking the Age of Dark with the 40-Year Famine.

ll# Yuadrem
**WIP.**

Yuadrem is a supercontinent, assumed to be the only continent in the world Darhoc.
The topography is varied, split by four different mountain ranges.
Due to its large extension from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the tundras of Krudzal to the rain forests of Drejek.

Humes are believed to have settled Yuadrem at least at 1000 B.S., much before written history.
The first settlers were Et and Om, with the other kins arriving some time after the fall of the Om.
The original kins lived in relative peace up until the Schism, a volcanic eruption that brought the 40-year famine and the fall of the Et.

## Geography
![Map of Yuadrem](img/world_map_v083.png)

The vast landmass is surrounded by four oceans:

* The Frigid Ocean to the north-east, which is known for its low temperatures and abundance of migratory idzels.
* The warm Teal Ocean to the north-west, home to very varied life.
* The Burnt Ocean to the east, which strangely holds very little marine life.
* The Southern Ocean to the south, the least explored of the four.

Due to its size, Yuadrem is often divided into six distinct regions: the [Northern Territories](world/northern_territories.md), the [Westlands](world/westlands.md), the [Fractured Lands](world/fractured_lands.md), the [Sunland](world/sunland.md), the [Savage Territories](world/savage_territories.md), and the [Wildlands](world/wildlands.md).

<!-- \DndDropCapLine{R}{eligion is an important part of life}
of the many cultures of Yuadrem.
Some worship specific pantheons of gods, others praise unpersonified concepts, and a selected few worship nature itself.
% In the times before the schism there was a wide belief that the tall kin could answer prayers, but their worship is now forbidden in most of the continent.

% The true existence of these divinities is a widely discussed subject, but their worship is undeniable.
From the nature-worshiping folk of Jenkash to the god-birds of Krudzal, each culture performs a set of rituals in the name of their deities, and some even claim to be able to channel their divine power.
While it might be hard to pinpoint the exact number of religions in Yuadrem, a few are built into the fabric of civilizations, and are easy to tell apart. -->

### Languages

A great variety of languages permeate Yuadrem, both of natural spawn and artificial design.
While it is impossible to identify each tongue and its variations, many efforts have been done over the years to classify the common ones.

Based on lexical and grammatical similarities, languages are separated into four generations, and five distinct families.
The following tables classify these languages, pointing to their script and original speakers. -->

<!-- % \paragraph{Old Tongue} A very complicated and intricate language spoken by the tall kin, the original settlers of Yuadrem.
% It's spoken form involves various complex articulations and the definition of a word can vary greatly based on the context.
% Additionally, each tall one had their own personal version of the written form, and others would understand it as much as they understood the individual.
% % This makes the reading of the old tongue extremely difficult for the kin that remain in the world, since understanding a particular tall one's scribbles essentially requires understanding their own version of the language.
% % Nowadays, only scholars and archaeologists understand the language, and it is not normally used anywhere.
% \paragraph{Marset Tongue} Every marset is already able to speak this strange, repetitive language.
% The marset tongue only has ten consonants, and ten verbs.
% % The rest of their vocabulary is built up from there, making their language very difficult to speak or understand by kins other than the marsets.
% Marset tongue can be spoken in one of two ways: soundlessly, through lip reading, or screamed as loud as possible, with no middle ground.
% The language cannot be written down.
% \paragraph{Naenk Tongue} Short words and strong consonants define the naenk tongue.
% Lacking lips and teeth, naenks make heavy use of their alveolar ridge and hard palate to produce syllables.
% The written form of the language involves carving lines and holes onto bark or stone.
% \paragraph{Outer Tongue}
% \paragraph{Mind Speech}

% \subsubsection{Second Generation}
% \paragraph{Dust Tongue}
% \paragraph{Ird Tongue}
% \paragraph{Gat Tongue}
% \paragraph{Leafrunes} Very easy to learn, but kept secret by the archer kin.
% A marset will teach this set of runes only to creatures that it deeply trusts, and only if it's strictly necessary.
% Ten leafrunes exist, all of which are used individually and to convey very simple meaning.
% % \textit{colony}, \textit{danger}, \textit{fun place}, \textit{hiding spot}, \textit{observation point}, \textit{predators}, \textit{road}, \textit{sacred place}, \textit{source of food}, and \textit{source of materials}.

<!-- \subsubsection{Language}
The tall kin spoke a very sophisticated language, known as jan-theth rlin, simplified as jantherlin.
This language allowed for a very profound expression of one's emotions and inner state, and is still used in poetry to this date.
For when deeper communication is needed, ets could meld their bodies and share thought, but the practice was only used in special rituals or to express especially complex abstract concepts.

As for written word, it was customary for the tall kin to chisel the stone, commonly carving a great variety of images alongside the text.
While this written language originates from jantherlin, each tall one had its own personal version of it.
Other ets could only comprehend one's writing as much as they understood the writer.
This makes the study of jantherlin extremely difficult to modern archaeologists.
% This makes the reading of the jantherlin extremely difficult for the kin that remain in the world, since understanding a particular tall one's scribbles essentially requires understanding their own version of the language.

## Islets
The Penance split Yuadrem into many different regions, called islets.
Exploration outside the islets has been very limited, and no contact has been made between them insofar.

Islets are commonly named for the regions in which they lay, and a (not exhaustive) list of them is:

* Fesh Peninsula.
* Katajthon Islet.
* Wildlands.
* [Krugghom Islet](islets/krugghom_islet/index.md).
* [Steldan Islet](islets/steldan_islet/index.md).

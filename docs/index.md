<!-- TODO list.
* Missing links.

# Yuadrem
Yuadrem was first settled by the firstborn oric gods, [Et](religion/godtrees/et.md) and [Om](religion/godtrees/om.md). Et was a large and thin birch, pliable and adaptable. Om was a short and stout juniper, vigorous and prodigious. These two gods were ever locked in combat, yet none could take the upper hand. This conflict became known as the War of Spring<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

To aid in the eternal battle, Et created the [humes](kins/hume.md), a kin as malleable as the god. Et bestowed upon humes Chromology<!-- TODO. Link. -->, teaching them to wage war using Color. Om in turn created [imates](kins/imate.md), a smaller kin able to traverse the forests of Et's children with ease. The imates were gifted Apomantics<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and fought using Word.

The conflict ended with the burning of both Et and Om, an event known as the [Schism](history.md#war-of-spring). The primordial one [Pheter](religion/primordials/pheter.md), angered by the death of the god, retaliated by striking Et with lightning. The blast burned the godtree, and brought the 40-Year Famine<!-- TODO. Link. --> to both humes and imates. This event marks the year 0, and the beginning of history.

## Geography
<!-- TODO LIST:
    * Finish the geography folder, + move mostly everything to the past tense. Make sure the reader knows that the world is dying!

![Map of Yuadrem](img/world_map_y604_v083.png)
***Pictured:***
_Trade map of Yuadrem, drawn in 604 A.S. (After the [Schism](history.md#war-of-spring)) by Marim of Avshen under the commission of Olag, the God-Suzerain of Naptane. The region colored in green corresponds to the Seven Protectorates of the Sea. Other colors represent the tax and penalty applied to trade in those regions. This map is proof of the healthy state of maritime travel and trade during the golden age._

Yuadrem is a supercontinent, the only such landmass in the world, Darhoc<!-- TODO. Link. -->. The topography is varied, split by four different mountain ranges. Due to its large extension from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the tundras of [Stinos](geography/northern_territories.md#stinos) to the rainforests of [Drejek](geography/westlands.md#krejek).

Due to its size, Yuadrem is often divided into six distinct regions: the [Northern Territories](geography/northern_territories.md), the [Westlands](geography/westlands.md), the [Fractured Lands](geography/fractured_lands.md), the [Sunland](geography/sunland.md), the [Savage Territories](geography/savage_territories.md), and the [Wildlands](geography/wildlands.md). In addition, the four oceans that surround it are:

* The Frigid Ocean to the north-east, which is known for its low temperatures and abundance of migratory idzels<!-- TODO. Link. -->, large sea monsters famous for wrecking ships during the golden age.
* The warm Teal Ocean to the north-west, home to a varied marine life.
* The Burnt Ocean to the east, both devoid of life and impossible to sail since the landing of [Cabb Goem-Rlamesh](geography/sunland.md#cabb-goem-rlamesh).
* The Southern Ocean to the south, the least explored of the four.
<!-- TODO. Maybe change most of this to the past tense? -->

## Sociology
### Politics
Back in the golden age, Yuadrem was split into various nations, each with their own population centers and varied economies. This era of peace lasted until the death of god-suzerain Olag<!-- TODO. Link. --> in 621 A.S. (After the Schism), an event that sparked the Penance<!-- TODO. Link. -->. With the Penance, an irisdescent tar known as nix<!-- TODO. Link. --> began rolling over the continent. This caused mass migrations, separating the peoples into isolas.

An isola is defined as a region either devoid of nix, or only seasonably affected by it. Most isolas are protected by their topography, often aided by strong sorcerers known as [Illuminants](religion/index.md#the-tanethist-pantheon). Up to the year 800 A.S., the only known isola was the [Fesh Peninsula](isolas/fesh_peninsula/index.md). After the arrival of the nixwalkers<!-- TODO. Link. -->, dentrala<!-- TODO. Link. --> apomancers<!-- TODO. Link. --> who travel over the vapors released by nix, it is now known that at least three others isolas exist: [Krugghom](isolas/krugghom/index.md), the [Steldan Isola](isolas/steldan_isola/index.md), and the Coldmist Gorge<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

<!-- TODO. Talk about the nations of the Fesh Peninsula. -->

### Ethnology
![Migration Map of Yuadrem, Old World](img/pre_penance_migration_y787_v012_dpi72.png)
***Pictured:***
*Old world migration map of Yuadrem, drawn in 787 A.S. by the Fremite Monastery in Uvarme. It includes all known mass movements of people from the [Ird Diaspora](history.md#war-of-spring) of ~80 B.S. to the Na'anian migration of 445 A.S. Migrations after the Penance are not pictured. The authors separated the four kins (and gats from irds) using colored lines.*

The peoples of Yuadrem are separated into four distinct kins. Each kin was created by a different godtree, and each was then further divided by ethnic differences. These differences led to the formation of nations during the Golden Age<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the erosion of which later led to the [sumis](isolas/fesh_peninsula/ane-kene.md#buda-and-sumi).

* [Humes](kins/hume.md), born from Et, are as adaptable as their creator. They became the dominant kin in Yuadrem after the Schism, and remain in this position even after the Penance.
* [Imates](kins/imate.md), born from Om, are hardy nomads that roam the remaining forests of Yuadrem. Decimated by both the War of Spring and posterior genocides, they have proven to be a deceptively hardy people.
* [Oths](kins/oth.md) are a moth-like kin, a quiet people with a natural tendency towards knowledge. Created by the godtree [Tol](religion/godtrees/tol.md), they're often seen as enigmatic as their creator.
* [Barkskins](kins/barkskin.md) are bone and wood golems, animated by the [god-tree Tek](religion/godtrees/tek.md). While often considered too aggressive for peaceful interaction, an alliance has been recently broken between them and the sumi of Fremit<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

<!-- TODO. Maybe talk a bit about each kin and their relevant migrations. -->

![Migration Map of Yuadrem, Age of Tar](img/age_of_fog_migration_y801_v011_dpi72.png)
***Pictured:***
*Age of Tar migration map of the Fesh Peninsula, drawn in 801 A.S. by the Fremite Monastery in Uvarme. It includes all mass migrations with their approximate dates.*

Different events in prehistory and history have caused migrations and diasporas, but none can be compared to The Penance. In the face of the vast loss of landmass to the nix tides, peoples from all nations and ethnicities coalesced in the Fesh Peninsula.

<!-- TODO. Maybe talk a bit about each migration? -->

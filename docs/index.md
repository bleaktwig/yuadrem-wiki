**WIP.**

<!-- TODO list.
Stuff required to finish wiki (for now):
* [ ] hide geography and isola pages (for now) and erase links to them.
* [ ] write general ethnology page from what's on index.
* [ ] clean up index.
* [ ] clean up kins in wiki and book.
* [ ] do an editing pass on book.
* [ ] remake character sheet from siniath ambar character sheet.
* [ ] write oths in wiki and book.

Other TODOs:
* Finish this first index page. It's the first thing player see in the wiki!
* Missing links.
* Clean up ref directory.
* Comment out the kin lore from the WAC document---for now, keep it only in the wiki. If i ever feel like it's sufficiently finalized, i can move on and set in on the book.
* Move images to subdirectories where they make more sense.
* Write a page on apomantics (in a new "sorcery" folder).
* Custom colors/theme would be nice, but maybe too much work. Evaluate.
* Finish the geography folder, + move mostly everything to the past tense. Make sure the reader knows that the world is dying!
* Customize this bitch a tad: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#custom-colors
* Try out new link style: [Schism](<history#War of Autumn>).

# Yuadrem
Yuadrem is the only continent in the world. It's topography was diverse, its broad vertical extension permitting a varied climate and a robust ecology. The landmass was painted with multi-colored forests, vast and beautiful deserts and tundras, rich-green jungles and savannas bursting with life, monumental mountains and deep canyons.

The land was first settled by the six original [god-trees](religion/index.md#god-trees), one for each color. They created all life on the continent, from the smallest ant to the largest whale, including the four sentient kins: the [hume](kins/hume.md), the [imate](kins/imate.md), the [oth](kins/oth.md), and the [elf](kins/imate.md).

This all changed in 621 After the [Schism](history.md#war-of-autumn) (A.S.), with the murder of the [god-suzerain Olag](religion/illuminants/olag.md). The world was assaulted by [nix](<religion/primordials/nix>), an all-consuming iridescent sap that is slowly eroding all disparity. The only inhabitable land now is the Fesh Peninsula<!-- TODO. Link. -->, a small arm jutting out from the Punika Peaks, protected from nix both by geography and apomantic incantations<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

_Old trade map of Yuadrem, drawn in 604 A.S. in Avshen, under the commission of the god-suzerain Olag. The region colored in green corresponds to the [Seven Princedoms of the Sea](history.md#age-of-winter), while other colors represent the tax and penalty applied to trade in the other lands of the continent. The map serves as a reminder of the healthy sate of trade and maritime travel during the [Age of Spring](history.md#age-of-spring), a once taken-for-granted boon now lost to nix._

### Politics
Back in the Age of Spring, Yuadrem was split into various nations, each with their own population centers and varied economies. This era of peace lasted until the death of god-suzerain [Olag](religion/illuminants/olag.md) in 621 A.S. (After the Schism), an event that sparked the [Penance](history.md#age-of-sap). With it, an iridescent sap known as [nix](religion/primordials/nix.md) began rolling over the continent. This caused mass migrations, separating the peoples into isolas.

An isola is defined as a region either devoid of nix, or only seasonably affected by it. Most isolas are protected by their topography, often aided by strong sorcerers known as [Illuminants](religion/index.md#illuminants). Up to the year 800 A.S., the only known isola was the [Fesh Peninsula](isolas/fesh_peninsula/index.md). After the arrival of the nixwalkers<!-- TODO. Link. -->, dentrala<!-- TODO. Link. --> apomancers<!-- TODO. Link. --> who travel over the vapors released by nix, it is now known that at least three others isolas exist: [Krugghom](isolas/krugghom/index.md), the [Steldan Isola](isolas/steldan_isola/index.md), and the Coldmist Gorge<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

<!-- TODO. Talk about the states and sumis of the Fesh Peninsula. -->

### Ethnology
The peoples of Yuadrem are separated into four distinct kins. Each kin was created by a different [god-tree](religion/index.md#god-trees), and each was then further divided by ethnic differences. These differences led to the formation of kingdoms during the Age of Spring the erosion of which later led to the [sumis](isolas/fesh_peninsula/ane-kene.md#buda-and-sumi).

* [Humes](kins/hume.md), born from Et, are as adaptable as their creator. They became the dominant kin in Yuadrem after the Schism, and remain in this position even after the Penance.
* [Imates](kins/imate.md), born from Om, are hardy nomads that roam the remaining forests of Yuadrem. Decimated by both the War of Autumn and posterior massacres, they have proven to be a deceptively hardy people.
* [Oths](kins/oth.md) are a moth-like kin, a quiet people with a natural tendency towards knowledge. Created by the god-tree [Tol](religion/godtrees/tol.md), they're often seen as enigmatic as their creator.
* [Elves](kins/elf.md) are bone and wood golems, animated by the [god-tree Tek](religion/godtrees/tek.md). While often considered too aggressive for peaceful interaction, an alliance has been recently broken between them and the sumi of Fremit<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

Different events in prehistory and history have caused migrations and diasporas, but none can be compared to the Penance. In the face of the vast loss of landmass to the nix tides, peoples from all origins and ethnicities coalesced in the Fesh Peninsula.

# Yuadrem
Yuadrem is the only continent in the world. It's topography was diverse, its broad vertical extension permitting a varied climate and a robust ecology. The landmass was painted with multi-colored forests, vast and beautiful deserts and tundras, rich-green jungles and savannas bursting with life, monumental mountains and deep canyons.

The land was first settled by the six original [god-trees](religion/index.md#god-trees), one for each color. They created all life on the continent, from the smallest ant to the largest whale, including the four sentient kins: the [hume](kins/hume.md), the [imate](kins/imate.md), the [oth](kins/oth.md), and the [elf](kins/imate.md).

This all changed in 621 After the [Schism](history.md#war-of-autumn) (A.S.), with the murder of the [god-suzerain Olag](religion/illuminants/olag.md). The world was assaulted by [nix](<religion/primordials/nix>), an all-consuming iridescent sap that is slowly eroding all disparity. The only inhabitable land now is the Fesh Peninsula<!-- TODO. Link. -->, a small arm jutting out from the Punika Peaks, protected from nix both by geography and periodic rituals<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

![Map of Yuadrem](img/world_map.yuadrem.y604.v083.dpi300.png)
_Old trade map of Yuadrem, drawn in 604 A.S. in Avshen, under the order of the god-suzerain Olag. The region colored in green corresponds to the [Seven Princedoms of the Sea](history.md#age-of-winter), while other colors represent the tax and penalty applied to trade in the other lands of the continent. The map serves as a reminder of the healthy sate of trade and maritime travel during the [Age of Spring](history.md#age-of-spring), a once taken-for-granted boon now lost to nix._

<!--^- TODO. I should update this map with the name changes (a bit annoying but it shouldn't take long c:) -^-->

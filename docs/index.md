# Yuadrem
*WIP.*

Yuadrem is a supercontinent, assumed to be the only continent in the world Darhoc.
The topography is varied, split by four different mountain ranges.
Due to its large extension from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the tundras of Krudzal to the rain forests of Drejek.

Humes are believed to have settled Yuadrem at least at 1000 B.S., much before written history.
The first settlers were Et and Om, with the other kins arriving some time after the fall of the Om.
The original kins lived in relative peace up until the Schism, a volcanic eruption that brought the 40-year famine and the fall of the Et.

## Geography
![Map of Yuadrem](img/world_map_v083.png)

The vast landmass is surrounded by four oceans:
* The Frigid Ocean to the north-east, which is known for its low temperatures and abundance of migratory idzels.
* The warm Teal Ocean to the north-west, home to very varied life.
* The Burnt Ocean to the east, which strangely holds very little marine life.
* The Southern Ocean to the south, the least explored of the four.

Due to its size, Yuadrem is often divided into six distinct regions: the [Northern Territories](world/northern_territories/index.md), the Three Deserts<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the Beryl Sea region<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the Whaler's Sea region<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the Savage Planes<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and the Wildlands<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

On the occidental side of the continent, the Beryl Sea and its surrounding landmasses.
*TODO.*

On the oriental side of the continent, the Whaler's Sea, littered by coasts and archipelagos.
*TODO.*

South of the Dead Sea are the Savage Planes.

The southernmost lands of Yuadrem are the Wildlands, a vast and mostly unexplored array of forests.

## Islets
The Penance split Yuadrem into many different regions, called islets.
Exploration outside the islets has been very limited, and no contact has been made between them insofar.

Islets are commonly named for the regions in which they lay, and a (not exhaustive) list of them is:
* Fesh Peninsula.
* Katajthon Islet.
* Wildlands.
* [Krugghom Islet](islets/krugghom_islet/index.md).
* [Steldan Islet](islets/steldan_islet/index.md).

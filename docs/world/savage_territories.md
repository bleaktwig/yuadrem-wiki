# The Westlands
<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------->
**TODO.**
<!-- To the east of Yuadrem are the Barbaric Territories, a region defined by the brutality of war and the greed of an empire.
From north to south, the land can be divided into five areas, each with its own distinct characteristics: the Drylands, Cabb Goem-Rlamesh, the Shield Sea, the Chirping Wilds, and the Xuam Peninsula. -->

## Geography

#### Mzavit River
**TODO.**
<!-- Down across the Mzavit River, the savanna becomes humid and with this water comes civilization.
A wide array of gat city-states have been established here.
Able to withstand the thunderous force of the Jenkashian and Iskenese armies and the hulking chimeras from the Next, these states are noteworthy for their fortitude.
Of special note is the adamant country of Byurev, who have halted the growth of Isken for almost three centuries. -->

#### Chirping Wilds
**TODO.**
<!-- Southeast from the Drylands and passing through the Do Nana swamp are the Chirping Wilds, a vast and largely untamed rainforest.
The jungle is inhabited only by the Iskenese empire, a large grung nation that expelled the original ird and marset population.
The only territories currently not held by the grungs' military might are the strong qulbaba irds of Harual to the west, and the marsets of Uzuz from the Xuam peninsula. -->

#### Savage Plains
**TODO.**
<!-- Just below the forking peaks and the Beal river is the northmost point of the Wildlands, the Savage Plains.
They are a humid subtropical area covered by marshes and plains, with few patches of forest in-between.
Fed by many rivers from the mountains, the lands define the southern territories of the Iskenese empire, expanding thorough the whole region.

However, Isken's grip on the Savage Plains is tenuous at best, as the region is as much controlled by the grungs as it is by the local wildlife.
Just as in the forest below, a great variety of foul beasts and creatures can be found in these swamps.
Of special note among these are the giant mole-like jinshus, beasts unique to region who suffocate the unprepared by sinking them beneath the earth. -->

#### Xuam Peninsula
**TODO.**
<!-- The Xuam Peninsula is the southermost point of the Barbaric Territories, and is located just south of the Grasping Gulf.
The region has facilitated the development of Uzuz due to the heavy presence of wurmroot, a white-leaf poplar tree that is conveniently toxic to all foreigner kins, specially to grungs. -->

#### Niknek Peninsula
**TODO.**
<!-- West of the Everwoods is the Niknek peninsula, a thin, elongated stretch of land filled with volcanoes and gorges.
The cape was spared from most of the effects of the Tidal Sway.
Niknek and the nearby Vuvu Isles now house the refuge marsets from the Ironlakes Island. -->

# The Northern Territories
<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------->
The Northern Territories span from the northmost point of Yuadrem, the Coldmist Gorge<!-- TODO. Add to map! -->, down to the Sulfur Lake.
The region is split into two by the Wall of Ice and Stone<!-- TODO. Link. -->, a colossal mountain range that spans from coast to coast.
While travel to and from the region is very rare, three islets are known to exist within it: the [Krugghom Islet][../islets/krugghom/index.md], the Coldmist Islet<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and the [Steldan Islet][../islets/steldan_islet.md].

<!-- GEOGRAPHY ---------------------------------------------------------------->
## Geography
![Cutout map of the Northern Territories][img/northern_territories_v083.png]

#### Whitenorth
North of the wall is the land of Whitenorth, home to the old nation of Krudzal.
The region coincides with the north pole of Darhoc, and is as cold and lifeless as can be expected.
The little plant-life that can be found is atop mountains and in the Coldmist Gorge, coinciding with civilization.
The latter is a crevasse which lies exactly on the pole.
It remains warm despite its location thanks to an array of volcanos in its center: the Peaks of Flame<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

#### Red Fjord
To the west of Whitenorth is the Red Fjord.
It receives its name from the red leaves of its maples, a color which predates the Penance<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
The islands are sacred to the Tsalemists<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and used to house both krudzalian colonies and Ribinhep nomads.

#### Greennorth
To the other side of the wall lies the Greennorth<!-- TODO. Change name in map. -->.
While unforgivingly cold, the region is not as frigid as the Whitenorth, and enough green can be found in the summer months to earn it its name.

At the top of the region and beside the wall are the Ashwoods<!-- TODO. Change name in map. -->.
Protected from the polar winds by the mountain range, these forests are home to maple, oak, birch and, giving them their name, ash trees.

#### Blank Fields
Then there are the Blank Fields: A vast, freezing tundra.
The low temperatures and strong winds prevent the growth of large flora.
As if the bleak terrain was not enough, it is the only above-ground home of the fierce Wurms<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the largest predators in Yuadrem.

#### Sulfur Lake
South of the Blank Fields lies the Sulfur Lake.
Fed by volcanic sources, the lake is unique across the continent: it corrodes the flesh of any who enter it.
The sulfur on its coasts once fed the agriculture of the great nations of Palegna and Sulia, both lost to the Penance.

#### Arctic Archipelago
East to the fields is the Arctic Archipelago.
This cluster of islands separates the waters of the Whaler's Sea from the Frigid Ocean up north.
The lands are bare and uninhabitable, and only the ruins of small port towns remain in their shores.

<!-- DEMOGRAPHY --------------------------------------------------------------->
## Demography
After the Penance, only two cultures remain in the region: the irds of Krudzal and the umes of Ribinhep.

#### Krudzal Nation
Krudzal was once a proud nation, locked in an everlasting war with the giants<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
It now only spans three small islets: Krugghom, Coldmist, and the Steldan Mountains<!-- TODO. Add to map. -->.
The islets are connected through a complex network of caverns and short highways through the nix.

In total, the nation has a population of about 80,000 inhabitants, mostly irds.
They are known for their extreme resilience, managing to acclimate both to the harsh habitat and to the nix.

#### Ribinhep Communes
In addition to the irds, small ume communes roam the Red Fjord and the Whitenorth.
While they mostly stay in the former, their merchants approach both the Steldan and the Coldmist islets on a regular basis.
These umes are nomadic, and are able to roam the nix thanks to their qualars<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
It is impossible to ascertain their exact population number, but it is estimated to be in the few thousands.

## Geography
![Cutout map of the Sunland](img/sunland_v083.png)

#### Zashlath
**TODO**.
<!-- South, through the Hammerfall canyon, is the Zashlath desert, the driest of the three.
Featureless and white, only the hardy sunstruck oths have been able to call the desert home, and even they are wise enough to only establish by the neighboring mountains.

Zashlath practically receives no precipitation, and its white-colored sands reflect the scorching sunlight to deadly effect.
Truth is the desert remains largely unexplored to this date, and only rumors exist about the horrors that might hide among its sands.
Famous among these is the Haimorrois, a red horned snake whose bite forces the blood out of one's body. -->

#### Drylands
**TODO**.
<!-- Northernmost are the Drylands, a field devoid of trees or any sort of tall flora.
The area is plain and parched, dried over the years for its lack of rains or rivers.
The northernmost area of the savanna remains bare to date, and is the most tortuous stretch between the Fesh Peninsula and the southern nations. -->

#### Cabb Goem-Rlamesh / Weeping Island
**TODO**.
<!-- % NOTE. In the whole island of Cabb Goem-Rlamesh a faint crying sound can be heard. -->
<!-- Off the coast of the Drylands lies a place known as the breathing island, Cabb Goem-Rlamesh.
A harrowing immensity, the landmass is constructed entirely of flesh and bone, and is believed to be what remains of the ets.
Not much is known about the island, and none of the few explorers who have traveled to it retain their sanity.
The mad tell tales of a mortifying city of flesh, and of strange, shape-shifting inhabitants. -->

#### The Forking Peaks
**TODO**.

#### Shield Lake and The Nest
**TODO**.
<!-- % Wrong information - geomancy was invented by an ancient civilization that warred with the tall kin eons ago, but was erased from history by the victors. There are ruins from this civilization at the basin of the lake, and Fo is the last remaining member from it.
Southwest of the Drylands rest the Shield Sea, an enormous body of water fed by a wide array of tributaries from the Forking Peaks.
In antiquity, the ruined ird civilization of Hairuus invented the art of geomancy in its coasts, raising from the basin the island of ``The Nest'' at its center.
The island currently hosts only one being, Fo.
Fo is a strange creature, rumored to be out of this world.
It welcomes visitors with a variety of fierce chimeras. -->

#### Ironlakes Isles
**TODO**.
<!-- Moving to the easternmost portion of the sea one can find the Ironlakes Island and the Zashlath savanna.
The former is a large island full of forests and lakes.
It was historically a part of the peaceful marset nation of Edede, but most of it now belongs to the warring empire.
The Zashlath savanna is the area west of the desert, protected from its dry air by the moisture of the cerulean waters. -->

#### Vuvu Archipelago

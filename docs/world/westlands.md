# The Westlands
<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------->
The Westlands stretch up to the Sulfur Lake to the north, the Ichor Mountains to the east, and the Drejek jungle to the west.
A variety of biomes define this region, all assailed by hot tropical temperatures.
Before The Penance<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the region was heavily populated by irds and naenks.
Three empires rose in the region: Hulnar<!-- TODO. Link. -->, Jenkash<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and Gannag<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
All are thought to have fallen in The Penance, as no contact has been established with them since.

<!-- GEOGRAPHY ---------------------------------------------------------------->
## Geography
![Cutout map of the Westlands][westlands_map]

#### Zoedrem
Zoedrem is a large yellow desert that touches both the Whaler's Sea to the east and the Teal Ocean to the west.
The desert runs undisturbed from the Sulfur Lake down to the Dratl River<!-- TODO. Add name to map. -->.
It used to be the most populated desert in Yuadrem, and the old empire of Hulnar was born in its sands.

#### Sylvan Canyon
East of Zoedrem is the Sylvan Canyon, a very hospitable land when compared to its neighboring desert and mountains.
The canyon walls protect its basin<!-- TODO. Is this the right word? -->, helping it grow grasslands and forests.
Apart from this shy plantlife, the area is known for its large salt and gemstone deposits.
The protectorates' colony of Viphoger was established to exploit this, but it too is now lost to The Penance.

#### Ichor Mountains
<!-- Then there are the Blank Fields: A vast, freezing tundra.
The low temperatures and strong winds prevent the growth of large flora.
As if the bleak terrain was not enough, it is the only above-ground home of the fierce Wurms, the largest predators in Yuadrem. -->

#### Beryl Sea

#### Dratl'fal Savanna
Long before The Penance, the Dratl'fal savanna was the first region to be struck by the Nix<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
Its name literally translates to "Bloodgrass" in Jantherlin<!-- TODO. Link. -->, as its flora grows with the characteristic red of the Nix.
The name also carries a more literal interpretation, as the Hundred Year War<!-- NOTE. Link? --> was fought on this land.

The south-eastern part of the region is also famous for the bafarmat, a purple moss that grows on its shores.
While abundant in the caverns below the Ichor Mountains, the moss only grows in this small area, and is the only food that can stimulate the gornbeetles<!-- TODO. Link. Hornbeetles are huge pack animals commonly used to move very large amounts of cargo --> to breed.
Even today, bafarmat is farmed by the nixwalkers both for selling and for multiplying their own hornbeetle population.

#### Drejek
<!-- South of the Blank Fields lies the Sulfur Lake.
Fed by volcanic sources, the lake is unique across the continent: it corrodes the flesh of any who enter it.
The sulfur on its coasts once fed the agriculture of the great nations of Palegna and Sulia, both lost to the Penance. -->

#### Qul Archipelago
<!-- East to the fields is the Arctic Archipelago.
This cluster of islands separates the waters of the Whaler's Sea from the Frigid Ocean up north.
The lands are bare and uninhabitable, and only the ruins of small port towns remain in their shores. -->

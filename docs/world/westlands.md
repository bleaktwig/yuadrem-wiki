# The Westlands
<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------->
The Westlands stretch up to the Sulfur Lake to the north, the Ichor Mountains to the east, and the Drejek jungle to the west.
A variety of biomes define this region, all assailed by hot tropical temperatures.
Before The Penance<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the region was heavily populated by irds and naenks.
Three empires rose in the region: Hulnar<!-- TODO. Link. -->, Jenkash<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and Gannag<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
All are thought to have fallen in The Penance, as no contact has been established with them since.

<!-- GEOGRAPHY ---------------------------------------------------------------->
## Geography
![Cutout map of the Westlands][westlands_map]

#### Zoedrem
<!-- North of the wall is the land of Whitenorth, home to the old nation of Krudzal.
The region coincides with the north pole of Darhoc, and is as cold and lifeless as can be expected.
The little plant-life that can be found is atop mountains and in the Coldmist Gorge, coinciding with civilization.
The latter is a crevasse which lies exactly on the pole.
It remains warm despite its location thanks to an array of volcanos in its center: the Peaks of Flame. -->

#### Fog Gorge
<!-- To the west of Whitenorth is the Red Fjord.
It receives its name from the red leaves of its maples, a color which predates the Penance.
The islands are sacred to the Tsalemists, and used to house both krudzalian colonies and Ribinhep nomads. -->

#### Dratl'fal Savanna
<!-- To the other side of the wall lies the Greennorth.
While unforgivingly cold, the region is not as frigid as the Whitenorth, and enough green can be found in the summer months to earn it its name.

At the top of the region and beside the wall are the Ashwoods.
Protected from the polar winds by the mountain range, these forests are home to maple, oak, birch and, giving them their name, ash trees. -->

#### Ichor Mountains
<!-- Then there are the Blank Fields: A vast, freezing tundra.
The low temperatures and strong winds prevent the growth of large flora.
As if the bleak terrain was not enough, it is the only above-ground home of the fierce Wurms, the largest predators in Yuadrem. -->

#### Drejek
<!-- South of the Blank Fields lies the Sulfur Lake.
Fed by volcanic sources, the lake is unique across the continent: it corrodes the flesh of any who enter it.
The sulfur on its coasts once fed the agriculture of the great nations of Palegna and Sulia, both lost to the Penance. -->

#### Qul Archipelago
<!-- East to the fields is the Arctic Archipelago.
This cluster of islands separates the waters of the Whaler's Sea from the Frigid Ocean up north.
The lands are bare and uninhabitable, and only the ruins of small port towns remain in their shores. -->

# The Fractured Lands
<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------->
**TODO.**
<!-- The cradle of modern civilization, the Whaler's Sea is home to both well-established and blooming countries.
Its coasts protected from harsh winds by mountain ranges and its cold waters supplied with both whale and idzel, the region couldn't be a better location to develop the modern world.
Idzels are large whale-like creatures known for their ship-sinking fury and their large supply of the valuable ambergris, the main ingredient in artificial qualars. -->

<!-- GEOGRAPHY ---------------------------------------------------------------->
## Geography

#### Horned Shores
**TODO.**
<!-- South of both islands are the Horned Shores and the Fesh Peninsula.
The first is known for its calm, dry mediterranean climate, its sparse forests, and the great concrete gat city-states that rise from its ground.
Most of the land is devoid of natural resources, with scarce mines and low-quality wood. -->

#### Fesh Peninsula
**TODO.**
<!-- East to these lands is the Fesh peninsula, an area inhabited mainly by gats, tortles and thulkraka irds.
A humid subtropical climate permeates the cape, and it is known for its harsh, capricious waters and frequent storms.
Also well-known are the tortles inhabiting the small island of Mbeat, for it is the only place where they have met safety after their arrival in Yuadrem.

In both regions lie the oldest nations of Yuadrem, the Seven Principates of the Sea.
Historically renowned raiders and pillagers, they are now famous for their passivity --- focusing on enterprise and artisanship.
What they offer is their expert craftgatship, and among them are the only bonecarvers capable of manufacturing qualars. -->

#### The Dead Sea
**TODO.**
<!-- Southeast of Zoedrem and across the Ichor Mountains lie the Dead Sea, an artificial desert created by the tall kin's folly.
The desert's sands are of a sickly gray color, and any creature that inhabit the land for too long suffer particular mutations.
Its inhabitants, the treb gats and the cursed umans are perhaps the best examples of this.

The sands become blacker the more you approach the spire, the largest mountain in Yuadrem.
The et city of Jan'krug stands atop it, where the ritual that caused the Schism took place.
A long chasm divides the eastern region of the Dead Sea, remnants of the passage of the breathing island, Cabb Goem-Rlamesh.
Surrounded by hill, mountain, and river, the desert naturally prohibits passage to it, almost as if it's protecting a twisted secret.

Apart from the kins that call this desert home, the Dead Sea is infested with other monstrosities.
These are categorized into two: The Nyxborn and the children of Cabb.
The former are giant insect-like creatures that can be as large as an elephant and as precise as a mosquito.
The latter are tormented amalgamates that dislodged from Cabb Goem-Rlamesh, ever haunted by insatiable hunger and unending pain.

% Along with the tortles, grungs, and umans, the Schism brought forth terrible creatures known as the Nyxborn.
% These insect-like monstrosities can be as huge as the Mirmekolon, a colossal ant-lion hybrid, or as precise as the Khanokoladtes, a palm-sized moth that pierces skulls with its sharp dart-like mouth. -->

# History and Cosmology
## Prehistory
First, there was only [Nix](religion/primordials/nix.md), the all-encompassing unity that is the cosmos. Then, in the _Nascency of Disparity_, the primordial one [Pheter](religion/primordials/pheter.md) was born from Nix. Along with Pheter came separation: void and form, heavens and earth, seas and land, and thus was born the continent of Yuadrem.

Now having ground to stand on, the primordial god continued to create disparity out of unity, while Nix observed from the Cosmos. In loneliness, they created light and dark through the damic gods: [Zash](religion/damic_gods/zash.md), the sun, and [Fagal](religion/damic_gods/fagal.md), the darksun. Zash, ecstatic to try shaping the world, joined her primordial parent in the act of creation. Together, they divided her light into six, and the mevic gods were born in the _Nascency of Color_.

They created weight by separating heaviness, Red, from lightness, Green, giving birth to [Vahan](religion/mevic_gods/vahan.md) and [Matevos](religion/mevic_gods/matevos.md). They created heat by separating warmth, Orange, from cold, Blue, giving birth to [Bagrat](religion/mevic_gods/bagrat.md) and [Febrid](religion/mevic_gods/febrid.md). And, finally, they created entropy by separating order, Yellow, from chaos, Purple, giving birth to [Pagram](religion/mevic_gods/pagram.md) and [Fusine](religion/mevic_gods/fusine.md).

After reaching adulthood, the mevic gods created something for the first time. In an act known as the _First Communion_, each conceived a seed and planted it into the land. Each seed then grew into a godtree—an oric god, from which all life on Yuadrem was born. This act, however, infuriated the first primordial one, for the seeds that the gods created had no opposite, and as such upset balance in the Cosmos. As punishment, Nix created the Ring of Color<!-- NOTE. Link. -->, which would become the prison of Pheter, Zash, and all the colors.

Furthermore, while Pheter and Zash were engrossed in their act of creation, Fagal had silently retreated to witness from the heavens, observing with resentment. While the divinities were lamenting their exile, the damic god struck the Ring and split it into two, forever separating the mevic gods from their siblings and thrusting Zash into the skies, to fly opposite to Fagal forevermore.

Back on Yuadrem, the godtrees realized they were free from the constrains that their predecessors had: they could create unimpeded by Nix's limitations. They created mineral, plant, and fungus, filling the continent with life. But it was [Om](religion/godtrees/om.md), the orange juniper, who added movement to this life. Through its fruit, it conceived fishes to roam the seas, animals to roam the lands, and birds to roam the skies.

But while the other godtrees rejoiced, one harbored jealousy. [Et](religion/godtrees/et.md), the blue birch, disagreed with Om, wishing for a cold, still world. It devised a plan, and spawned the first intelligent species to help enact it: the [humes](kins/hume.md).

## War of Spring
**TODO.**

<!--* **War of Spring.** The largest of the oric gods, Et and Om, go into war. While no damic or mevic god interfered, Pheter themself was against the conflict. Humes are born from Et as soldiers in this war, while Om creates the imates to defend themself.-->

<!-- TODO. Add the Ird Diaspora + the first siege of Ctereth. -->

<!--* **The Schism.** After a long and bloody conflict, Et wins the war against Om. Under the orders of their godtree, the gats burn down the godtree of the imates. As the fire spreads, Pheter creates the fundamental signature of lightning on the surface of the moon Kegal, and uses it to strike down Et. The ash from the burned godtrees engulfs Yuadrem, sparking the Age of Dark with the 40-Year Famine.-->

# History and Cosmology
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Prehistory
First, there was only [Nix](religion/primordials/nix.md), the all-encompassing unity that is the cosmos. Then, in the ***Nascency of Disparity***, the primordial one [Pheter](religion/primordials/pheter.md) was born from Nix. Along with Pheter came separation: void and form, heavens and earth, seas and land, and thus was born the continent of Yuadrem.

Now having ground to stand on, the primordial god continued to create disparity out of unity, while Nix observed from the Cosmos. In loneliness, they created light and dark through the [damic gods](religion/index.md#damic-gods): [Zash](religion/damic_gods/zash.md), the sun, and [Fagal](religion/damic_gods/fagal.md), the darksun. Zash, ecstatic to shape the world, joined her primordial parent in the act of creation. Together, they divided her light into six, and the [mevic gods](religion/index.md#mevic-gods) were born in the ***Nascency of Color***.

They created weight by separating heaviness, Red, from lightness, Green, giving birth to [Vahan](religion/mevic_gods/vahan.md) and [Matevos](religion/mevic_gods/matevos.md). They created heat by separating warmth, Orange, from cold, Blue, giving birth to [Bagrat](religion/mevic_gods/bagrat.md) and [Febrid](religion/mevic_gods/febrid.md). And, finally, they created entropy by separating order, Yellow, from chaos, Purple, giving birth to [Pagram](religion/mevic_gods/pagram.md) and [Fusine](religion/mevic_gods/fusine.md).

After reaching adulthood, the mevic gods created something for the first time. In an act known as the ***First Communion***, each conceived a seed and planted it into the land. Each seed then grew into a god-tree—an oric god, from which all life on Yuadrem was born. This act, however, infuriated the first primordial one, for the seeds that the gods created had no opposite, and as such upset balance in the Cosmos. As punishment, Nix created the Ring of Color<!-- NOTE. Link. -->, which would become the prison of Pheter, Zash, and all the colors.

Furthermore, while Pheter and Zash were engrossed in their act of creation, Fagal had silently retreated to witness from the heavens, observing with resentment. While the divinities were lamenting their exile, the damic god struck the Ring and split it into two, forever separating the mevic gods from their siblings and thrusting Zash into the heavens, to fly opposite to Fagal forevermore.

Back on Yuadrem, the god-trees realized they were free from the constrains that their predecessors had: they could create unimpeded by Nix's limitations. They created mineral, plant, and fungus, filling the continent with life. But it was [Om](religion/godtrees/om.md), the orange juniper, who added movement to this life. Through its fruit, it conceived fishes to roam the seas, animals to roam the lands, and birds to roam the skies.

But while most god-trees rejoiced, one harbored jealousy. [Et](religion/godtrees/et.md), the blue birch, disagreed with Om, wishing for a cold, still world. It devised a plan, and spawned the first sentient creature to enact it: the [hume](kins/hume.md).

<!--NOTE. Include a picture of the ring of color?-->

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## War of Autumn
Following Et's wishes, humes crafted swords and spears, built cities and fortresses, conducted fire and thunder, and even tame and commanded some of Om's own creations. The first city-states, Fiele, Ashen, and Alagias<!-- TODO. Link? -->, were built in this time, as were too the eight Forts of Autumn<!-- TODO. Link? -->.

Om, fearing the humes' fire, produced a sentient creature of its own, the [imates](kins/imate.md). Imates could not build like humes, but they were blessed with Word<!-- TODO. Link. --> by their creator. Via Word, they wielded the essence of Pheter that remained after the god's departure, conducting the six aspects of the mevic gods. Weight, heat, and entropy could be wielded as shields against humes, and thus imates created apomantics<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

While apomantics proved an effective barrier, the blue god-tree had another gift for the humes in store. It gifted them Color<!-- TODO. Link. -->, through which they could also govern the remaining essence of Pheter, and thus humes created chromology<!-- TODO. Link. -->

As the war between oric gods burned brighter and brighter, many humes became disillusioned by their maker's goals. Over time, desertion became increasingly common, leading to the ***Ird Diaspora***, and the separation of hume civilization into the [gat](kins/hume.md#gat-culture) and [ird](kins/hume.md#ird-culture) cultures.
<!--NOTE. Maybe talk a bit more here about the 4 "faces" of the ird diaspora; thulkrakan, hairusse, qulbaban, and dratlean. *Or*, make a new page only on the ird diaspora. -->
<!-- First siege of Ctereth by the armies of healing -- irds-->

Ultimately, in one final siege, the humes arrived at the base of a tired Om, and, wielding Color, set the god-tree on fire. The oric god burned through months, as the gats carried with the mass murder of imates in what's known as the ***Ededian Genocide***.

Pheter, dismayed by the work of their own creation, punished Et for demanding such atrocities. They engraved the fundamental signature of lightning upon Fusine, and then sent her to the heavens. From there, she used the signature to summon great thunder onto Et, fulminating the god-tree in an instant, and marking year 0 in the calendar in a day known as the ***Schism***.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Age of Winter
_0 to 195 A.S._

With the raging fires that consumed both Et and Om having no end in sight, the soot and ash of both god-trees clouded the sky all-around the planet. The smoke cover led to an unnaturally-long winter, starting a period known as the ***40-year Famine***. This led to a further division of humes, with gat culture now shattering into two: the bughna who left Et behind by adopting a nomadic lifestyle; and the noves who, despite the state of their land, decided to stay near the charred corpse of their god.

Over time, more and more noves unified under the embrace of one of the last Et-born<!--TODO. Link.-->, one last gift of the god-tree to its children. A gat that later came to be known as the [god-suzerain Olag](religion/illuminants/olag.md), under whom the noves enjoyed the start of a flourishing civilization. Olag founded the first kingdom, Vamerit<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and later built its capital<!--TODO. Link. --> using the charred remains of Et as outer walls. This day, the 11th of Amuvean, 96 A.S., is celebrated to this day as the ***Founding of Naptane***.

Seeing the magnificence of the Et-born's labor, most of the the neighboring tribes swore fealty to Olag. Many, however, feared the unification brought by them and attacked the young empire. This is known as the ***100-year War***, which was ended by Olag's skill at bargain and warfare. Upon unifying the peoples of the [Horned Shores](geography/fractured_lands.md#horned-shores), the gat separated it into seven princedoms: Dnomit, Khedrat, Meritan, Ushpavam, Vamerit, Viphoger, and Xarxage. Each was ruled by its own prince, which would have to answer to the command Olag, the suzerain. The ***Establishment of the Seven Princedoms of the Sea***, which occurred on the 6th of Aduvinean, 195 A.S., marks the start of the next age.

<!-- TODO.

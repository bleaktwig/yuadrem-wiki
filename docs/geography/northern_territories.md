# The Northern Territories
<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------->
The Northern Territories span from the northmost point of Yuadrem, the Coldmist Gorge<!-- TODO. Add to map! -->, down to the Sulfur Lake.
The region is split into two by the Wall of Ice and Stone<!-- TODO. Link. -->, a colossal mountain range that spans from coast to coast.
While travel to and from the region is very rare, three isolas are known to exist within it: the [Krugghom Isola](../isolas/krugghom/index.md), the Polar Isola<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and the [Steldan Isola](../isolas/steldan_isola.md).

<!-- GEOGRAPHY ---------------------------------------------------------------->
## Geography
![Cutout map of the Northern Territories](img/northern_territories_v083.png)

#### Stinos
North of the wall is the land of Stinos, home to the old nation of Krudzal.
The region coincides with the north pole of Darhoc, and is as cold and lifeless as can be expected.
The little plant-life that can be found is atop mountains and in the Coldmist Gorge, coinciding with civilization.
The latter is a crevasse which lies exactly on the pole.
It remains warm despite its location thanks to an array of volcanos in its center: the Peaks of Flame<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

#### Golden Fjord
To the west of Stinos is the Golden Fjord.
It receives its name from the yellow leaves of the [Ur](../religion/godtrees/ur.md).
The islands are sacred to the Tsalemists<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and used to house both krudzalian colonies and Ribinhep nomads.

#### Gualos
To the other side of the wall lies Gualos<!-- TODO. Change name in map. -->.
While unforgivingly cold, the region is not as frigid as Stinos, and enough green can be found in the summer months to earn it its name.

At the top of the region and beside the wall are the Ashwoods<!-- TODO. Change name in map. -->.
Protected from the polar winds by the mountain range, these forests are home to maple, oak, birch and, giving them their name, ash trees.

#### Blank Fields
Then there are the Blank Fields: A vast, freezing tundra.
The low temperatures and strong winds prevent the growth of large flora.
As if the bleak terrain was not enough, it is the only above-ground home of the fierce Wurms<!-- TODO. Link. -->, the largest predators in Yuadrem.

#### Sulfur Lake
South of the Blank Fields lies the Sulfur Lake.
Fed by volcanic sources, the lake is unique across the continent: it corrodes the flesh of any who enter it.
The sulfur on its coasts once fed the agriculture of the great states of Palegna and Sulia, both lost to the [Penance](../history.md#age-of-sap).

#### Arctic Archipelago
East to the fields is the Arctic Archipelago.
This cluster of islands separates the waters of the Whaler's Sea from the Frigid Ocean up north.
The lands are bare and uninhabitable, and only the ruins of small port towns remain in their shores.

<!-- Krejek and Kaljek? -->

<!-- DEMOGRAPHY --------------------------------------------------------------->
## Demography
After the Penance, only two cultures remain in the region: the irds of Krudzal and the umes of Ribinhep.

#### Krudzal Nation
Krudzal was once a proud nation, locked in an everlasting war with the giants<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
It now only spans three small isolas: Krugghom, Coldmist, and the Steldan Mountains<!-- TODO. Add to map. -->.
The isolas are connected through a complex network of caverns and short highways through the nix.

In total, the nation has a population of about 80,000 inhabitants, mostly irds.
They are known for their extreme resilience, managing to acclimate both to the harsh habitat and to the nix.

#### Ribinhep Communes
In addition to the irds, small ume communes roam the Red Fjord and Stinos.
While they mostly stay in the former, their merchants approach both the Steldan and the Coldmist isolas on a regular basis.
These umes are nomadic, and are able to roam the nix thanks to their qualars<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
It is impossible to ascertain their exact population number, but it is estimated to be in the few thousands.

# The Westlands
<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------->
The Westlands stretch up to the Sulfur Lake to the north, the Ichor Mountains to the east, and the Drejek jungle to the west.
A variety of biomes define this region, all assailed by hot tropical temperatures.
Before the [Penance](../history.md#age-of-spring), the region was heavily populated by [irds](../kins/hume.md#ird-culture) and [barkskins](../kins/barkskin.md).
Three empires rose in the region: Hulnar<!-- TODO. Link. -->, Jenkash<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and Gannag<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
All are thought to have fallen in he Penance, as no contact has been established with them since.

<!-- GEOGRAPHY ---------------------------------------------------------------->
## Geography
![Cutout map of the Westlands](img/westlands_v083.png)

#### Zoedrem
Zoedrem is a large yellow desert that touches both the Whaler's Sea to the east and the Teal Ocean to the west.
The desert runs undisturbed from the Sulfur Lake down to the Dratl River<!-- TODO. Add name to map. -->.
It used to be the most populated desert in Yuadrem, and the old empire of Hulnar was born in its sands.

#### Sylvan Canyon
East of Zoedrem is the Sylvan Canyon, a very hospitable land when compared to its neighboring desert and mountains.
The canyon walls protect its basin<!-- TODO. Is this the right word? -->, helping it grow grasslands and forests.
Apart from this shy plantlife, the area is known for its large salt and gemstone deposits.
The princedom of Viphoger was established to exploit this, but it too is now lost to the Penance.

#### Ichor Mountains
Separating the deserts of Zoedrem and the Dead Sea are the Ichor Mountains.
Their name comes from the many tributaries they birth, most of which feed the Dratl River.
While thick, the mountain range is somewhat sparse, and a variety of passages connect the Westlands to the Dead Sea<!-- TODO. Link. --> and the Seven Princedoms<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

#### Beryl Sea
The Beryl Sea is a large expanse of warm water.
Its violent winds, battering waters, and unpredictable thunderstorms make sailing it essentially impossible for anyone but the Qulbaba irds of Jenkash.
Yet no nixwalker<!-- TODO. Link. --> has reported ships since The Penance, and the once great empire is thought to be lost to it.

#### Dratl'fal Savanna
Long before The Penance, the Dratl'fal savanna was the first region to be struck by the nix<!-- TODO. Link. -->.
Its name literally translates to "bloodgrass" in [Jantherlin](../languages/index.md#etian-family)<!-- TODO. Link. -->, as its flora grows with the characteristic red of the nix.
The name also carries a more literal interpretation, as the Hundred Year War<!-- NOTE. Link? --> was fought on this land.

The south-eastern part of the region is also famous for the bafarmat, a purple moss that grows on its shores.
While abundant in the caverns below the Ichor Mountains, the moss only grows in this small area, and is the only food that can stimulate the anthutes<!-- TODO. Link. Anthutes are huge pack animals commonly used to move very large amounts of cargo --> to breed.
Even today, bafarmat is farmed in the city-state of Jorea<!-- TODO. Link. -->, whose populace sell to the nixwalkers.

#### Drejek
Westernmost of Yuadrem is the thick, dark, and moist jungle of Drejek.
This region is the birthplace of the Gannag civilization, which spawned the barkskin.
While born before [The Schism](../history.md#war-of-autumn), it is unknown if the nation survived The Penance, since no contact has been made since.

#### The Fog Gorge
**TODO**.
<!-- East to Drejek is the Fog Gorge, a well-forested canyon island ever enveloped in fog.
While primitive, the tribes of Gannag are far from free-living, and are bound by strong shackles to their superiors.
While naenks are used to this hierarchical system, many of the more intelligent tsaneks grow tired of it over time.
A hundred and fifty years ago, a group of tsaneks went as far as to establish their own independent tribe of Na'ane in the misty island, abandoning their brethren in favor of an unrestrained lifestyle.
Freely they carry on with their ceremonies and rituals, protected from their neighbors by mist and stone. -->

#### Qul Archipelago
Defining the southern border of the Beryl Sea is the Qul Archipelago.
The islands are almost completely desolate, as very few foliage can grow in its ash-ridden earth and igneous rock.
The Jenkashian empire was born from this land, and their own deforestation is what drove them to their great expansion.

<!-- DEMOGRAPHY --------------------------------------------------------------->
## Demography
No civilization remains in the Westlands after The Penance.

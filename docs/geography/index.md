Due to its size, Yuadrem is often divided into six distinct regions: the [Northern Territories](geography/northern_territories.md), the [Westlands](geography/westlands.md), the [Fractured Lands](geography/fractured_lands.md), the [Sunland](geography/sunland.md), the [Savage Territories](geography/savage_territories.md), and the [Wildlands](geography/wildlands.md). In addition, the four oceans that surround it are:

* The Frigid Ocean to the north-east, which is known for its low temperatures and abundance of migratory idzels<!-- TODO. Link. -->, large sea monsters famous for wrecking ships during the [Age of Spring](history.md#age-of-spring).
* The warm Teal Ocean to the north-west, home to a varied marine life.
* The Burnt Ocean to the east, both devoid of life and impossible to sail since the landing of [Cabb Goem-Rlamesh](geography/sunland.md#cabb-goem-rlamesh).
* The Southern Ocean to the south, the least explored of the four.
<!-- TODO. Maybe change most of this to the past tense? -->

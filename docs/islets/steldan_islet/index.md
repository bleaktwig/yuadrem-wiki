# Steldan Islet
The Steldan Islet lies at the north-western end of the [Steldan Mountains](TODO), above the [Wall of Ice and Stone](TODO).
The islet is home to **TODO** people, of which most are [irds](TODO).
After the [Penance](TODO), the lower plains of the region were flooded with nix over the course of the years.
The population fled up the mountains, establishing many of the towns that are populated today.
This isolated them from the rest of [Yuadrem](TODO), thus establishing the islet.

The inhabitants of the islet have not had any contact with the outside world for almost two centuries.
Three currents of thought have developed in this time: [Statism](politics/statism), [Liberalism](politics/liberalism), and [Recuperationism](politics/recuperationism).

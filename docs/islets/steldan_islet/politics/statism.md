# Statism
*Longevity Above All*.

Statists believe that a strong state can lead the islet to security and longevity.
The doctrine was born after [The Penance](TODO), and have been dominant for the whole [postpenance era](TODO).
Statism reacts to the immediate and long-term thread of [nix](TODO).
Via a strong state, it seeks to preserve the citizens of [Krudzal](TODO).
The dominant doctrine of the steldan islet, it is the basis upon which the government is built.

## Principal Beliefs
* **Longevity above all**.
Statism focuses its need for survival in two fronts: allowing its population to survive in the postpenance era, and preserving the long history of Krudzal.
For the former, it gives absolute power to the state.
A low degree of personal freedom and high degree of control allows it to best preserve the life of the individual.
For the latter, it created vaults: underground libraries below each town hall, each with a copy of the complete literature of the Fatherland.
The keeping of these vaults and the copying itself is done by the [Fatherland Conservation Ministry (FCM)](../../groups/fcm).

* **Monopoly on violence**.
Statists defend a total monopoly of power by the state.
Personal possession of weapons is prohibited.
The state can *lend* weapons to members of three groups, the [Steldan Resident Militia (SRM)](../../groups/srm), the [Steldan Exploration Front (SEF)](../../groups/sef), and the newer [Steldan Debridement Front (SDF)](../../groups/sdf).

* **Control of trade**.
The steldan state exerts complete control of the market.
The [Trade and Coin Ministry (TCM)](TODO) defines the price of each product and service.
In the case of a product not registered, the artisan or seller must sell it for twice the cost of the raw materials.
The SRM ensures that all markets follow this regulation.

* **Citizens first policies**.
All policies must think first of the citizens.
For a new law to be passed, it must be approved by the [Citizen Welfare Ministry (CWM)](../../groups/cwm).
This institution evaluates how each law affects the individual, shaping each for her/his maximum benefit.

## Relation to Other Doctrines
* [**Liberalism**](../liberalism).
Most statists are against liberalism.
It is commonly seen as a rebellious movement, and it used to not be taken seriously.
This has somewhat changed after the election of [Neri](TODO) as the [udtere](../hierarchy) of [Northcliff](TODO), an open liberalist.
While the state hasn't condemned her, protests and unrest are becoming common in the town.

* [**Recuperationism**](../recuperationism).
Statism is not directly opposed to recuperationism, but it is only a secondary focus when poised against the welfare of the individual.
Most citizens of the islet don't take the doctrine seriously, thinking it an impossible dream.
While this mostly remains true today, it gained traction after the previous [ead](../hierarchy) [Nernet](TODO) annouenced the Steldan Debridement Front.
This front is dedicated to understanding the nix, and ideally venturing into it in the near future.

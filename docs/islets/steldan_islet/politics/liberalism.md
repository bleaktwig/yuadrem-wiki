# Liberalism
*Progress in Growth*.

Born as a counter-culture to statism, liberalists advocate for individual action and enterprise.
While some expansion has occurred under the statist government, it has been slow.
Liberalists claim that allowing people to travel unbound by state law should speed up this search.
Simultaneously, they campaign for an unregulated market and less control on weapons.
This philosophy is to allow the accumulation of capital, thus allowing the individual to explore further out in the islet.

## Principal Beliefs
* **Progress in Growth**.
Liberalists see the steldan society as stagnant.
They see the government's focus on safety as a limit to the growth of the nation.
They believe that this lack of growth curbs the progress of individuals.
There is only so much to do in such a small and limited society.
To end this, most think that more focus should be given to the [Steldan Exploration Front (SEF)](../../groups/sef) and the [Steldan Debridement Front (SDF)](../../groups/sdf) -- yet mostly to the former.

* **Individual freedom**.
Liberalists condemn the removal of personal freedom of the statist government.
They claim that this vulneration is a wrong greater than the right of keeping the individual safe.
While most don't think badly upon the conservation of records from Krudzal, they do criticize the large allocation of funds and labor to this end.

* **Democratization of violence**.
Advocates of this doctrine also advocate for laxer control on weapons.
By limiting access to weapons, the state puts a dent on any action outside town walls.
Naturally, this seriously limits any capacity of the people to establish new settlements, or even outposts.

* **Free market**.
A deregulation of market should help individuals accumulate capital.
Untrusting of the state, they see this accumulation as a mean to finance exploration to the far reaches of the islet.

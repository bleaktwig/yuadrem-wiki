# Tanethism
Tanethism was founded by the gat Taneth in 511 AS.

## Pantheon
Modern Tanethism has a five-level hierarchy of deities, out of which the first four levels are considered gods.
* **Primordial Ones** are the gods behind consciousness, and are the creators of both mevic and oric gods.
    * ***Pheter*** is the giver of thinking -- every conscious thought in the mind of a creature comes from her will.
    She is commonly drawn as a 5-colored heron whose path is painted by northern lights.
    * ***Nix*** is the taker of thinking.
    He is the author of [The Penance](TODO), and his aim is to return the world to animals.
    He is commonly drawn as a dark red raven surrounded by never dispersing mists.
* **Mevic Gods** or *bone gods* are the sons and daughters of Pheter, and each represent a different facet of her.

## History
Old Tanethism is characterized by its myriad of gods -- one for each thing.
This urreligion was widely practiced in the Seven Principates and their various colonies up until the late [Nations Era](TODO).

Taneth, a gat theologist, published "The Rituals and Gods of the Gats" in 511 AS.
Independent of any institution, the scholar traveled all around the gat kingdoms and city-states, compiling all information he could find on the gods of each community.
The book was an exhaustive compilation of the more than a thousand deities that were praised on the Seven Principates, and he proposed a believable hierarchy that contained all of them.
Furthermore, he introduced a reduced pantheon of 18 gods, of which two were later expunged by the god-king Olag.
Taneth's work was barely known during his life, and he died without due recognition at an unknown age.

Shortly before the start of the [Golden Era](TODO), Olag sought to reduce the religious disparity among his people.
Either by divine will or happenstance, he came upon the book, and established Tanethism as the official religion of [Khedrat](TODO).
By government decree, many churches were erected in the name of these gods, and the many gods of the gats coalesced into a sober pantheon of 16.
Soon after the religion was picked-up by the rest of the seven principates, followed by its establishment in many gat (and non-gat) states around Yuadrem.

<!-- Many have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teaching they make their own.
A few even dedicate entirely to a single deity, serving as a priest, acolyte, or champion of that god's image.
Famous among these devout beings are the nimrod, an organization of zealous hunters of Phusinhe who pursue all who disturb the balance of Yuadrem.
Well-known as well are the followers of Havetish, a group of gats in golden robes whose goal is to distribute wealth and food to the impoverished hamlets of the inner regions of the Seven Principates.

# Tanethism
Old Tanethism is characterized by its myriad of gods -- one for each thing.
This religion was widely practiced in the Seven Principates<!-- TODO. Link. --> and their various colonies up until the late Age of Gold.
This however changes in the year 520 A.S., when god-suzerain Olag establishes a new Tanethism as the official religion of the principates.

The book was published by Taneth in 511 A.S.
To write it, the scholar traveled all around the various principates and city-states.
He ended up with an exhaustive compilation of the more than a thousand deities praised in the region.
In this taxonomy, Taneth classified the similitudes and differences between each god.
Based on these similitudes, he then proposes a reduced pantheon in which similar gods coalesce, along with a clear, tiered hierarchy between them.

Taneth's work was barely known during his life.
He died shortly after the publication, and not even his birth date is know.

Many a [hume](../kins/hume.md) has a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teaching they make their own.
A few even dedicate entirely to a single deity, serving as a priest, acolyte, or champion of that god's manifestation.
Some famous examples among these devouts are the nimrods, an organization of zealous hunters of Pagram who would pursue all who disturb the perceived balance.
Another example are the followers of Havetish, who to this date seek to distribute wealth and food to the impoverished habitants in the inland regions.

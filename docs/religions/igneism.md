<!-- The oth scholars hailing from Ignelli were the first to conceptualize the tides.
They learned that the tides are intrinsically woven into sentience.
As tightly tied threads between sentient creatures, a change in the tidal alignment in one has profound effects in that of those nearby.
% Each tide was then assosiated with a symbol and an entity, to give a more concrete face to it and facilitate its worship.

The blue tide is represented by a blue unfinished book, representing the eternal pursuit of knowledge.
The gold tide is symbolized as a seed or an egg, telling of the coming of future life with proper nourishment.
Indicated by a torch, the indigo tide tells of the truth revealed under light, and the punishment exerted upon those who hide it.
A broken compass represents the red tide, representing the roaming of those who walk without roads.
The silver tide's symbol is a bell, denoting the attention obtained by those who seek fame.

Nearing the year 174 AS, the knowledge of the tides split the Ignelli school in two - The Igneists and the Rashiists.
% The Zelseists, who simply sought to further understand this new discovery, and the Rashiists, who attempted to wield and manipulate them.
The latter created a system of magic known as Rashid, with which they could potentiate the tidal alignment of others.
Despite the warnings issued by their sister school, the Rashiists honed their craft to its maximal potency, and suffered severely from it.
Their actions awoke a strange an antique and mysterious creature: The Sorrow.

% The Sorrow is a being of indescribable shape who was summoned to Yuadrem by the Rashiists' folly.
Breaking the mind of any who lay their eyes upon it, it swiftly took the lives of all who corrupted the balance of the tides, thus ending the Rashiist school's folly.
Its presence caused the pale blemish, and with it came horrid creatures known now as the xuagra.
Seeing the destruction caused by their sister school, the Igenists hid the knowledge of their former brethren, forbidding Rashid in any shape or form.
% Finally, they changed their own name to Igneists in an attempt to bury the other school in anonymity.

Igneism is the worship of the tides as a concept, and the active pursuit of keeping the five balanced.
Igneists recognize that sentience cannot exist without the tides, and praise them as thanks for the capacity of independent thought. -->

<!-- It is indubitable that astral concepts are commonly associated to divinities, and no religion reflects this as clearly as Tsalemism.
Tsalemism is a belief that originally gained popularity in the coasts of Krudzal, quickly becoming the official religion of the nation and of many thulkraka irds.
Due to its proximity to the north pole, Krudzal experiences long polar days and nights every year, and this irregular schedule naturally led to the personification of night and day.

Day is associated to Jua\~nansiz, a rainbow-colored heron that brings daylight and colors to the entirety of the polar region.
Jua\~nansiz eternally hunts Dzadsiz, a black raven who in turn seeks to tire the heron and finally feast on its exhausted body.
The birds' duel is unending, and the wreckage of their battle is used to explain the chaotic fjords in the Northern Territories.

The boreal lights seen near the pole are Jua\~nansiz's trail.
The mountainous landscape of the Whitenorth are the places where Dzadsiz fell, struck by the heron.
% The endless mists were created by the raven in an attempt to hide from Jua\~nansiz.
These and many other natural phenomena of the Northern Territories are explained by the birds and their eternal duel.

The two birds are not worshiped equally, but their wrath is feared by all.
A sailor may produce a small temple to appease Dzadsiz before sailing, and a cartographer may sing a praise to Jua\~nansiz before taking flight. -->

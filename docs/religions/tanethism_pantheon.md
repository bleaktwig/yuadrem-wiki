# The Pantheon of Tanethism
## The Two Primordial
The two primordial are the forces of creation, and the highest divinities in the pantheon.

#### Nix
Nix is the god of Unity and the Cosmos. Their body is the cosmos: everything that exists is borrowed from them, and must eventually be returned. Too many portrayals of Nix exist, all equally as valid. Yet, their most common representation is that of a bare-faced curassow with iridescent feathers.

Nix manifests in Darhoc<!-- TODO. Link. --> as a black, iridescent tar, named nix<!-- TODO. Link. -->. This tar is the mix of all things, and is produced when a sorcerer<!-- TODO. Link. --> consumes pheter<!-- TODO. Link. --> to cast spells.

#### Pheter
Pheter is the god of Disparity and Creation. They were born in the Nascency of Disparity, and their arrival meant the creation of everything. Pheter is the progenitor of the Damic gods, and all creation can be attributed to them. Their representation is a pair of maguari storks, with an equal balance of the six colors moving across their bodies.

Pheter is the source of magic that allows apomantics<!-- TODO. Link. --> to work. For this, their body manifests as a transparent, inodorous matter that permeates the entirety of Darhoc, simply named pheter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Damic Gods
The damic gods, or *first gods*, are the gods of light and dark, and are the firstborns of Pheter.

#### Zash
Zash is the goddess of Light and Luck. Her manifestation is Color, and she is often associated with beer, hospitality, the [Buni](../isolas/fesh_peninsula/ane-kene.md#ivu) and [Fasi](../isolas/fesh_peninsula/ane-kene.md#bulu). She is the sun, creator of Color, and mother of all Mevic gods. Zash is often referred to as The Traveler, and is often portrayed as an indistinct figure cloaked in a light brown robe. Her representation is a great white egret, her white feathers reflecting the blinding light of the sun.

#### Fagal
Fagal is the god of Dark and the Unknown, and their manifestation is the Nothing. They are the darksun<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and are associated with the [Taka and the Nuga](../isolas/fesh_peninsula/ane-kene.md#ivu). Thanks to Fagal there is saturation in color, as darkness gives the value to a hue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Mevic Gods
The mevic gods, or *bone gods*, are the six aspects of Zash. They are the manifestation of Pheter through Zash, and came to be in the Nascency of Color. Each god inhabits their own section in the Ring of Color<!-- TODO. Link. --> that surrounds Darhoc.

She's not often portrayed as a hume -- but as a gargantuan black-bellied slider turtle whose shell shines with a million stars.

#### Vahan
Vahan is the god of Red, heaviness, and mountains. His manifestation is fire.
Vahan is said to prefer bolos with high self-sufficiency, and is thus celebrated though [Pali](../isolas/fesh_peninsula/ane-kene.md#bulu) and [Mafa](../isolas/fesh_peninsula/ane-kene.md#buda-and-sumi).

#### Om
Om, also known as Tosh-drieln, is the tree of Bagrat, a vigorous juniper. In the War of Spring, Om created the [marsets](../kins/marset.md) to defend itself against the humes of Et. The tree was burned at the beginning of the Schism, and its burnt trunk still stands at the center of the [Fesh peninsula](../geography/fractured_lands.md#fesh-peninsula). Its complex root system forms the many islands in the Turtle Sea<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

#### Ur

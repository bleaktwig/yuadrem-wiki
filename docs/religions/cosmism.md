<!-- \subsubsection{Cosmism}
While the worship of the tall ones is forbidden, their own religious ideas persist in the form of Cosmism.
Cosmism is related to the search of one's place in the larger scheme of things, dubbed the ``cosmos''.
The Observer is the manifestation of the elusive concept of this cosmos, an omnipresent god observing all of Yuadrem at once.

The ideas behind the doctrine were originally conceived by the ets in time immemorial, and cosmists are generally met with disdain and criticism.
Due to this, many acolytes of the religion practice their rituals in the protection of the darkness, and it's very rare to see a church openly dedicated to cosmism.

Cosmism explains some of the strange phenomena of Yuadrem as the whims and thoughts of The Observer.
The tides are the reactions of The Observer to the actions of each being.
Qualars are the medium by which people can commune with The Observer, granting them some of Their wisdom.

% Cosmists fear the cosmos, and carry strange and surreptitious rituals to appease The Observer or gain its favor.

However, what may be shunned in the surface can always find its place underground.
There seems to be a deep connection between the search of oneself in the larger scheme of things and the ego death experienced in the tsanek melds.
Many temples and ritual places exist in the mushroom cities of the cave-dwelling fungal kin, and cosmism is the official religion of the tsanek nation of Na'ane.
% Tsaneks view the cosmos with curiosity, and seek to understanding through observation and hypotheses. -->

# Languages
There are currently 16 recognized languages spoken in the Fesh Peninsula<!-- TODO. Link. -->, most of which have many dialects. They are split into two distinct sections: _Omietian_ and _Uldian_ language trees.

![Language Tree](../img/language_tree.y798_v100_dpi300.png)
_A comprehensive overlook of the languages spoken in the Fesh Peninsula, 798 A.S.. The branches represent the divergence of families, while the leaf clusters are the languages currently spoken. The size of each leaf cluster is a rough approximation of the number of speakers by the year of production. Recorded by the Umean monastery._

_Omietian languages_ are those that were taught by [Et](../religion/godtrees/et.md), [Om](../religion/godtrees/om.md), and [Tol](../religion/godtrees/tol.md) to their respective kins: [humes](../kins/hume.md), [imates](../kins/imate.md), and [oths](../kins/oth.md). While etian and omian branches were taught by different godtrees, they share many common roots, leading to the theory that they sprung from one original tongue.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Etian Branch
**Jantherlin** is the earliest known language that is still spoken. It was taught by Et to the first humes, and has been carefully preserved over the years by monks and scholars. In modern times, Jantherlin is only spoken in academic contexts, and its writing system is the base of the etian apomantic system<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
### Avshenesian Family
Over time, Jantherlin evolved into most of the languages spoken in Yuadrem, the largest branch of which is the _avshenesian family_. Originally spoken in the Seven Protectorates, it spread far into the continent, only for the different tongues to coalesce again into the Fesh Peninsula<!-- TODO. Link. -->. The avshenesian apomantic system<!-- TODO. Link. --> started from Avshenese, the mother language of the family, and is the most commonly used apomantic system thanks to its simplicity and similitude to Frisian.

[**Frisian**](frisian.md) was spoken in the peninsula before the [Penance](../history.md#age-of-fog), and remains the most common vocabulary in the region. It is currently spoken in the sumis of Fremit, Ushpavam, Vamerit, and Xarxage, as well as in the Holy Nation of Ushpavam and the Nation of Meritan. A dialect of old Avshenesian, very similar to Frisian, is also spoken by the chiefdoms of Raraspan and Dzarog, as well as by the Ketepi people.
<!-- TODO. Lots of links are needed here. -->

**Shanise** was the main language spoken in the [Northern Territories](../geography/northern_territories.md), and it branched out from Avshenese in the thulkrakan side of the [Ird Diaspora](../history.md#war-of-spring). As of today, it is only spoken in the Nation of Gronselar<!-- TODO. Link. -->. Shanise is the basis for the gronselarian apomantic system<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

**Voskian** is a family of dialects that developed north of the [Zoedrem desert](../geography/westlands.md#zoedrem), with the dispersion of the Bughna people in the northern bughna migration<!-- TODO. Link. -->. It is not currently spoken in any nation, but the family is very common in the six thousand tribes<!-- TODO. Link. --> and the peoples of Saefel<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

**Beast Speech** is an artificial vocabulary forged in Voskferm<!-- TODO. Link. -->, a nation that disappeared in the Penance. The language was designed to communicate with the highly intelligent Anthutes<!-- TODO. Link. -->, large horned mammals that were once common in that region. It is now used by merchants and travelers to ride these animals across the sumis and nations of the Fesh Peninsula.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
### Harualian Family
Some time before the avshenesian family sprouted from Jantherlin, the _harualian family_ started taking shape after the hairusse, qulbaban, and dratlean sides of the Ird Diaspora. While many harualian languages existed in the old world, only two are known to have survived the Penance.

**Qualinese** was spoken in the Jenkashian empire. While the empire was lost to nix, some of its citizens migrated to and established in the Fesh Peninsula. The language is now spoken by the Puneui people<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and is the second most common in the sumi of Fremit<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

**Zsekian** defined the Hulnar empire. Very few native speakers remain in the modern world, but the tongue still sees some use in the chiefdoms of Raraspan<!-- TODO. Link. --> and Dzarog<!-- TODO. Link. -->, as well as by the Ketepi people<!-- TODO. Link. --> to the west.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
### Shamabic Family
After the godtree Tol spawned from the corpse of Et, it spawned the oth kin. Oths quickly integrated into the Seven Protectorates, but cultivated their own vocabularies directly from Jantherlin: the _shamabic family_.

**Fruenese** was the first language made by the oths. It is highly practical and has a very simple syntax, reflecting the pragmatism of the kin. Fruenese is now the main tongue spoken in the chiefdom of Nalash<!-- TODO. Link. --> and the island of Trevit<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

The **Silent Tongue** was the second language developed by oths. It doesn't have a writing or oral system, as it uses only visual-manual signs to convey meaning. Despite it being artificial, it has split into many different dialects over the years. It is spoken in the entirety of the Fesh Peninsula, but is seen the most in the sumi of Fremit. It is the basis for the dentralin apomantic system<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

The **True Tongue** was the third and final language in the shamabic family. It's heavily based on Fruenese, but it adds to it a large set of unique and very complicated grammatical rules. These make it exceedingly hard to learn, but give it a unique advantage: it is impossible to lie in True Tongue, hence its name. True Tongue is most commonly spoken by scholars and monks.

<!-- NOTE. A historic moment when someone managed to lie -- in true tongue -- during a trial would be so metal. -->

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Omian Branch
**Babazano** was taught to the imates by Om, and is the only language in the _marsetian family_. It is very repetitive and has little verb variety, making it easy to learn. It consists of only 10 consonants and 4 vowels, turning lip reading into a very easy skill to acquire for its speakers. Currently, Babazano is the only tongue spoken in the Nation of Om<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
### Naenkian Family
Since Tek talks through its root system and spores, the godtree did not teach any tongue to the [barkskin](../kins/barkskin.md). They were, however, later taught verbal language by the imates, establishing communication between the two kins. Barkskins learned a modified version of Babazano adapted to their unique morphology, which turned into the _naenkian family_.

**Gannagian**, sometimes referred to as Old Knaenese, is the first tongue forked from Babazano. Lacking teeth and lips, barkskins communicate only with their alveolar ridge and palate, and as such Gannagian words have very rough sounds, and are hard to learn for members of the other kins. Gannagian is only spoken in Gannag<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and is the basis for the gannagian apomantic system<!-- TODO. Link. -->.

**Knaenese** is the most common tongue in the naenkian family, and is spoken in the chiefdom of Knagan<!-- TODO. Link. -->. The barkskin there, unable to rely on Tek's roots and spores, had to develop their language to something much more complex than the simple Gannag.

**Leaf Runes** is a script imagined by imates and barkskins that was used to communicate between the two. The words are written into trees, and the shape of each glyph depends on the texture of their bark. This makes it very hard for the other kins to understand the writing, but is fairly simple for the imates and barkskins thanks to their intimate relation with trees. Leaf Runes are mostly used to provide secretive guidance in forests.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Uldian Tree
Under the tutelage of the godtree [Uld](../religion/godtrees/uld.md), the oths of Ignelli<!-- TODO. Link. --> invented the _uldian tree_ of languages. These didn't spread far from the [everwoods](../geography/wildlands.md#everwoods), but somehow managed to survive the Penance.

**Odhualen** is a very unique tongue, sharing almost no characteristic with the other dialects of Yuadrem. It is the main language spoken in the island-nation of Mbeat<!-- TODO. Link. -->, and it has also recently gained popularity among scholars due to the conciseness of its writing system.

**Krelho** was a variation of Odhualen as it spread across the [Wildlands](../geography/wildlands.md). It has almost disappeared after the Penance, and finding native speakers is almost impossible.

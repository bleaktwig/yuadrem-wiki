## Constituent Order Typology
### Constituent Order in Main Clauses
Frisian, as well as the other languages derived from Avshenese, are of a mixed constituent order.
Yet, they are all Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) languages.

1. **e te gume kukufe**

    3SS - 3SP home - PST3S leave

    "He left his home"

### Verb Phrase
Adverbs only precede the verb.
In the following example, we see **xerevo** *already/previously* precedes the verb **fufuse** *was*.

2. **dad e xa e thate xerevo fufuse fofovene**

    (COORD) and - 3SS - (COMP) that [3SS - good - already PST3S is] - PST3S learn

    "And he learned that he was already good"

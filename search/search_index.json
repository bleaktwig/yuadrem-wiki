This religion was widely practiced in the Seven Principates and their various colonies up until the late Age of Gold. This however changes in the year 520 A.S., when the god-suzerain Olag establishes a new Tanethism as the official religion of the principates.</p> <p>The religion is based on a book published by Taneth in 511 A.S. To write it, the nomadic scholar traveled all around the various principates and city-states. He ended up with an exhaustive compilation of the more than a thousand deities praised in the region. In this taxonomy, Taneth classifies the similitude and difference between each god. Based on these, he then proposes a reduced pantheon in which similar gods coalesce, along with a clear, tiered hierarchy between them.</p> <p>Taneth's work was barely known during his life. He died shortly after the publication, and not even his birth date is known.</p> <p>Many a hume has a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teaching they make their own. A few even dedicate entirely to a single deity, serving as a priest, acolyte, or champion of that god's manifestation. Some famous examples among these devouts are the nimrods, an organization of zealous hunters of Pagram who would pursue all who disturb the perceived balance. Another example are the followers of Havetish, who to this date seek to distribute wealth and food to the impoverished habitants in the inland regions.</p> <p>Other religions do exist, but receive little attention in the modern world.

Tanethism is the most common religion in Yuadrem. It is the most common belief of all gats since the fifth century.  Tanethism is a personal religion. Altars to certain gods are common, but established institutions to them are a rare sight, and is even prohibited in some provinces.</p> <p>Apart from providing the list and description of the religion's gods, the book of Taneth details the myriad of rituals to each of them.

A gat may prefer to use this name if a parent was particularly important. Furthermore, additional parent names can be added after the first, climbing up a branch of the family tree.</li> <li>A profession name is simply the name of the profession practiced by the gat.</li> <li>A family name, which is acquired by all members of a family upon joining.

While many different ethnicities came from this event, the main ones that remain after the Penance are three. In order of their number, the thulkraka, the qulbaba, and the dratl.</p> <p>The thulkraka migrated to the northernmost regions of Yuadrem, establishing the old nation of Krudzal around the north pole. Here, they were the first to develop ironworking, with which they built imposing sailing ships with iron hulls. Krudzalites used these vessels to claim many territories in the continent, later forming many independent states such as Gronselar and Kaldrathal, among others.</p> <p>The qulbaba were the second to emigrate, and settled on the tropical islands of the Qul Archipelago. Here they separated into a myriad of chiefdoms, claiming the islands and many nearby territories. While they never achieved complete cooperation between chiefs, they became known as the Jenkash Empire at their maximum expansion.</p> <p>Inside the Fesh Peninsula, thulkraka from Gronselar conquered the easternmost peninsula, establishing their nation in territories claimed from Ushpavam. Some qulbaba from the Dentralin Chiefdom also  settled the region, becoming part of the Sumi of Fremit and establishing temples in the Saefel Canyon.</p> <p>The dratl were the last to leave the grasp of Et.

Competitions are very common to irds, and are the preferred way to settle disagreements. They are usually as public as possible, and are often encouraged and celebrated by others. These matches can involve anything the participants deem necessary. If they are expected to lead to physical injury or death, the chief is to be informed beforehand, and they must either bear witness or anoint someone to do so. Dratl competitions are particularly ferocious, and they often involve combat or violence.</p> <p>Promise of Allegiance. As long as both people are willing, anyone can make a public promise of allegiance to another. The person making the vow is called the First, while the other is the Second. In this commitment, the First promises to fight and obey any command of the Second. In exchange, the Second must always be fair to the First, and provide home, food, and water to them.</p> <p>It is common for the whole chiefdom or a large part of it to make a promise of allegiance to the chief. The vow lasts until the death of any of either person. If a First or Second fails to fulfill their part, they may be judged and exiled, depending on the local ruler and the choice of the other.</p> <p>Children and Marriage. Before marriage, irds are encouraged to meet and form bonds with others, usually many at a time. When a woman becomes pregnant, she decides who among her suitors is to be the father. In southern thulkraka culture, however, she can decide on many suitors at once. They then must complete a set of challenges of the bride's choosing. The winner becomes the groom, while the others are to act as servants during the wedding.</p> <p>The marriage celebration is generally large, and the whole chiefdom or village is expected to take part in it. As their vows, both members are expected to make a promise of allegiance to the other, such as the one they have with their chiefs.</p> <p>Adulthood. To become an adult, a child must participate in a competition held in a Day of Change. The particular Days of Change vary across cultures, but all are aligned with the tri-lunar tidal phases, as seen in the Nuagalian Calendar. Victors in these matches then become adults, while other contestants must wait for subsequent Days of Change. Adulthood is a requirement to make a promise of allegiance, and as such one cannot marry before becoming an adult.</p> <p>Death and Funerals. Irds believe that a person's soul remains in the body after they die. No funeral is celebrated upon death, and bodies are blindfolded and laid to rest inside a communal crypt. Thulkraka keep oil urns with the bodies, burning the crypt on the Day of the Immortal, a leap day that occurs every 10 years. Dratl kept their crypts open, allowing vultures to eat the remains and the desert sun to dry the rest.

Common examples include bands in the arms and legs, rings, and braid rings. Piercings in the face and ears are the sign of adulthood in the kin.

Adoption in general only occurs between mother and daughter families, and even in this context it is rare.</p> <p>Dual dwellings. Traditional imate villages consist of two room styles. The larger are wood and fiber circular huts, built on the trunks of trees. These are used for storage and to house adult oras. Where the dirt allows, patches of farmland surround these huts, and are worked by the oras.</p> <p>Then, the branches of the same trees are covered in interconnected chambers, built from weaving grass and plant fibers. Three types of these arboreal rooms exist: shared housing for adult arsets, nurseries for all imate younglings, and farming rooms. In these last ones, arsets leave a mixture of chewed leaves and bark, growing mushrooms from otherwise inedible foraged material.</p> <p>In Fesh, it is common to see one or two of these arboreal communities inside towns and villages. While historical differences still rift the kins, the Penance has forced the formation of these mixed communities.</p> <p>Death and return to Om. It is a common belief that a dead imate's soul can only return to Om if its body rots under the earth. Imates traditionally bury their dead below their farmlands, and thus the huts of the oras serve to mourn the recently dead.</p> <p>For this reason, imates are very reacious to the barkskin cycle of birth, since it retards their process of reunification with their god. Furthermore, burning a dead body is extreme sacrilege. If an imate dies by burning or in any way that won't allow its body to rot, as the their soul will never find their way back to Om.</p> <p>Specialized roles. Due to their differences, oras and arsets tend to take different roles in their society. Arsets, being small and mobile, hunt, scout, and trade with neighboring villages. Oras, larger and stronger, defend the village, along with tending plantations, attending the young, and crafting items and accessories. Traditionally, one or more oras act as the village shamans, conducting rites and communing with the recently dead.</p> <p>Tradition and Tanethism. Imate tradition follows the belief in the divinity of the tree-gods and their relation to the Ring of Color. They associate the god-trees to the six world signatures, and have unique signatures for each of the seven trees.

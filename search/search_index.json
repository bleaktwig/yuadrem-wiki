In loneliness, they created light and dark through the damic gods: Zash, the sun, and Fagal, the darksun. Zash, ecstatic to shape the world, joined her primordial parent in the act of creation. Together, they divided her light into six, and the mevic gods were born in the Nascency of Color.</p> <p>They created weight by separating heaviness, Red, from lightness, Green, giving birth to Vahan and Matevos. They created heat by separating warmth, Orange, from cold, Blue, giving birth to Bagrat and Febrid. And, finally, they created entropy by separating order, Yellow, from chaos, Purple, giving birth to Pagram and Fusine.</p> <p>After reaching adulthood, the mevic gods created something for the first time. In an act known as the First Communion, each conceived a seed and planted it into the land. Each seed then grew into a god-tree\u2014an oric god, from which all life on Yuadrem was born. This act, however, infuriated the first primordial one, for the seeds that the gods created had no opposite, and as such upset balance in the Cosmos. As punishment, Nix created the Ring of Color, which would become the prison of Pheter, Zash, and all the colors.</p> <p>Furthermore, while Pheter and Zash were engrossed in their act of creation, Fagal had silently retreated to witness from the heavens, observing with resentment. While the divinities were lamenting their exile, the damic god struck the Ring and split it into two, forever separating the mevic gods from their siblings and thrusting Zash into the heavens, to fly opposite to Fagal forevermore.</p> <p>Back on Yuadrem, the god-trees realized they were free from the constrains that their predecessors had: they could create unimpeded by Nix's limitations. They created mineral, plant, and fungus, filling the continent with life. But it was Om, the orange juniper, who added movement to this life. Through its fruit, it conceived fishes to roam the seas, animals to roam the lands, and birds to roam the skies.</p> <p>But while most god-trees rejoiced, one harbored jealousy. Et, the blue birch, disagreed with Om, wishing for a cold, still world. It devised a plan, and spawned the first sentient creature to enact it: the hume.</p>"},{"location":"history/#war-of-autumn","title":"War of Autumn","text":"<p>Following Et's wishes, humes crafted swords and spears, built cities and fortresses, conducted fire and thunder, and even tame and commanded some of Om's own creations.

Imates could not build like humes, but they were blessed with Word by their creator. Via Word, they wielded the essence of Pheter that remained after the god's departure, conducting the six aspects of the mevic gods. Weight, heat, and entropy could be wielded as shields against humes, and thus imates created apomantics.</p> <p>While apomantics proved an effective barrier, the blue god-tree had another gift for the humes in store. It gifted them Color, through which they could also govern the remaining essence of Pheter, and thus humes created chromology</p> <p>As the war between oric gods burned brighter and brighter, many humes became disillusioned by their maker's goals. Over time, desertion became increasingly common, leading to the Ird Diaspora, and the separation of hume civilization into the gat and ird cultures.</p> <p>Ultimately, in one final siege, the humes arrived at the base of a tired Om, and, wielding Color, set the god-tree on fire.

The smoke cover led to an unnaturally-long winter, starting a period known as the 40-year Famine. This led to a further division of humes, with gat culture now shattering into two: the bughna who left Et behind by adopting a nomadic lifestyle; and the noves who, despite the state of their land, decided to stay near the charred corpse of their god.</p> <p>Over time, more and more noves unified under the embrace of one of the last Et-born, a parting gift of the god-tree to its children. A gat that later came to be known as the god-suzerain Olag, under whom the noves enjoyed the start of a flourishing civilization. Olag founded the first kingdom, Vamerit, and later built its capital using the charred remains of Et as outer walls. This day, the 11th of Amuvean, 96 A.S., is celebrated to this day as the Founding of Naptane.</p> <p>Seeing the magnificence of the Et-born's labor, most of the the neighboring tribes swore fealty to Olag. Many, however, feared the unification brought by them and attacked the young empire. This is known as the 100-year War, which was ended by Olag's skill at bargain and warfare. Upon unifying the peoples of the Horned Shores, the gat separated it into seven princedoms: Dnomit, Khedrat, Meritan, Ushpavam, Vamerit, Viphoger, and Xarxage. Each was ruled by its own prince, which would have to answer to the command Olag, the suzerain. The Establishment of the Seven Princedoms of the Sea, which occurred on the 6th of Aduvinean, 195 A.S., marks the start of the next age.</p>"},{"location":"history/#age-of-spring","title":"Age of Spring","text":"<p>195 to 621 A.S.</p> <p>Shortly after the princedoms were founded and a ziggurat was erected on each capital, the empire started reaching outside their original territories of the Horned Shores and the Fesh Peninsula. Both land and sea commerce routes were charted with the many nascent kingdoms in the continent, forming peaceful relations with the bughna gats and the irds. The same luck was not shared by the imates, however, as Olag resumed the slaughter that had stopped with the Schism, forcing the kin further and further south during the Babaian Wars from 231 to 261 A.S.</p> <p>Interesting developments also unraveled inside empire, with the Nascency of the Fey in the early Age of Spring. From the charred rim of Et's trunk, which now served as Naptane's outer wall, a seventh god-tree bloomed: Tol. This tree, while a birch like its parent, did not share its association with Blue, but rather a sickly white color. It also did not birth humes, but rather the fey, a kin that quickly established itself alongside humes in the Seven Princedoms of the Sea and in the lands to the south.</p> <p>In addition to the fey, explorers to the west of the continents found yet another new kin, the elves. Born from the god-tree Tek, this people had nothing in common with the other kins, and no friendly relationship was ever established between them and gats until after the collapse of the princedoms.</p> <p>Olag, perhaps emboldened by the new perceived threat to the west, chose to further separate the already divided humes: in the year 358 A.S., they decreed the Exile of the Treb: the treb, commonly seen as the most brutish of the gats, were to be removed from the Seven Kingdoms. Most treb had part of their hands amputated, a sign now known as the Mark of Exile, and sent to the Dead Sea to die between the white sands and the scorching sun. Many survived, however, and formed chiefdoms likes Raraspan and Nalash, which exist to this date.</p> <p>The god-suzerain's imperial ambitions only grew with time. After pushing the imates as far south as the Chirping Wilds, they sought to control each kingdom and region on their warpath. This strained the empire, however, and a strained relation between the suzerain and the protected princes led to the princedom of Viphoger to declare itself independent. Olag not only could not stop this fracture in their reign, but was also unable to quell the ever-growing unrest in the Seven Princedoms.</p> <p>Then, when the princedom of Xarxage declared independence, the Et-born unleashed again the greatest horror in history. In the year 620 A.S., they cast an incantation not seen since the War of Autumn\u2014the fundamental signature of lightning. Thunder fell upon Alagias, the princedom's capital, ending the rebellion while fulminating every living creature in the city.</p> <p>This act both established the god-suzerain's reign as supreme, and was the seed of their death. Only a year after it, during the night of the nineteenth of Divunean, while sitting on a throne built at the core of Et's stump, Olag was murdered by an unknown assassin. The murderer, now known as Laver, was taken to the heavens by Fusine herself. This is known as the Night of the Fourth Color, and marks the end of the Age of Spring.</p> <p></p> <p>Approximate map of migrations during the Age of Winter and the Age of Spring.

Some argue that it came in response to the murder itself, while others that it is in response to the suzerain's use of the signature of lightning. Whichever be the case, the wrath of the gods was unleashed upon Yuadrem in a moment in time known now as the Penance.</p> <p>Slowly at first, a black iridescent sap started to sprout from the suzerain's throne in the corpse of Et. This sap is the manifestation of the god of Unity Nix, and bears their namesake. Nix has always been a well-known product of sorcery, but it had never been seen flowing in such a way. This flow, while slow, didn't stop. It consume the throne. The holy ziggurat. The capital Naptane. The god-tree's remains. Then the entirety of the princedom of Vamerit.</p> <p>The flow hastened with every year that passed, and there was no end in sight to the horror. Panic overtook the peoples of Yuadrem. The Seven Princedoms disbanded quickly and without ceremony, while mass migrations became the norm. Every pocket of safety disappeared under sap within months, if not days. Kingdoms collapsed as their castles crumbled and the rubble was swallowed. The end of the world seemed inevitable.</p> <p>In this hopeless situation rose Nikoleta, a sorceress and scholar of Nix from the monastery of Fremit in the year 682 A.S.. She created an incantation that could ward against the spread of the sap, then cast it atop Mount Tashta, using the geography of the Punika and Widure mountain ranges to aid in the protection of the Fesh Peninsula. Her journey and ritual are commemorated as the Pilgrimage of Nikoleta, and are repeated yearly by the sorcerers of the sumi of Fremit to maintain the incantation's effect.</p> <p>The Fesh Peninsula, now a haven of safety among a drowning world, became the destination for millions of immigrants. Perhaps the most unexpected of these was the oric god Tek and its kin, the elves. The god-tree lifted the entire Drejek plateau using its root system, dragged it across the continent, to then crash it between the Punika and Puneui mountain ranges. This is known as the Landing of Drejek, and happened between the years 734 and 737 A.S..</p> <p>Another abrupt event was the War of Summer that has raged since 761 A.S., and erupted with the arrival of ships from the far-south kingdom of Gronselar. The imates and irds of this land, filled with a thirst for retribution for the many massacres against the former, invaded the only princedom that remained: Ushpavam. The war was harsh on both sides, but the southern peoples had the advantage. Gronselar took over both the Newe Plateau, while imates established the new Kingdom of Om in the Turtle Sea and the coastline south of Ushpavam, separating the exhausted kingdom in two.</p> <p>This partition led to the collapse of Ushpavam into two: the Sumi of Ushpavam to the west, and the Holy Princedom of Ushpavam to the east. While the former signed the Treatise of Five Bridges in 796 A.S. to end the carnage, the latter is still locked in war with Gronselar and the Kingdom of Om to this date.</p> <p></p> <p>Approximate map of migrations during the Age of Sap.
